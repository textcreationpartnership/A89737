            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>This Miniſterial Spirit reſted not only upon that great Doctor of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> but alſo reſts, and acts in its meaſure, in all the Miniſters of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, for the calling, and compleating of the Elect, until we all come to be a perfect man. So as there
<pb facs="tcp:118295:4"/>is not to be found a more vigorous effuſion of the Bowels of Jeſus; in any of the hearts of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men, then is in the ſouls of the Miniſtry: no bowels either of civil, or natural relations ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed theirs: the love of them is wonderful, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing the love of <hi>Ionathan,</hi> that paſſed the love of women. By the unboſoming hereof as with a key, the Apoſtle in his Epiſtle, opens the heart of the Reader; whilſt the <hi>Coloſsians</hi> behold the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the writer:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Col.</hi> 2.2.</note> 
               <hi>I would to God ye knew what great conflict I have for you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence (I hope) in its meaſure is this preſent labor for the truths ſake, for your ſake, for the ſake of any, that in the Lord ſhall accept thereof, and for conſcience ſake.</p>
            <p>To this end was I born, and for this cauſe came I into the world, to bear witneſs unto the truth. So our Lord Jeſus, notwithſtanding the Truth was that which the <hi>Jews</hi> then maligned, and <hi>Pilate</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided, ſee the Spirit of Chriſt an <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> and a <hi>Moraliſt,</hi> the difference between piety, Maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and neutrality concerning the truth.</p>
            <p>Nothing is more contended for, nothing more contended againſt, then the truth. The Goſpel truth as it is moſt dear to God, ſo is it moſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned by Satan. As the Attribute of the Holy One is the Spirit of truth: So the wicked one, is called a lyar from the beginning. Concerning it, are the greateſt thoughts of heart, the moſt intenſe endeavors of Tongues, Pens, and Swords: It being much more beloved of its followers then Life: and more hated of its oppoſers then death.</p>
            <p>Truth is the excellency of things, where truth is
<pb facs="tcp:118295:4"/>there may be a bad action, but where truth is not, there cannot be a good action. <hi>Paul</hi> ſuppoſeth a man may give his Body to be burned in a good cauſe, and it profit him nothing. 'Tis not the ſuffering and the cauſe alone; both ſuffering, cauſe and Spirit, muſt concur to make a Martyr. In a bad cauſe it holds univerſally, <hi>Who hath required theſe things at your hand?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mans interpretation of the Scripture, is not Gods mind, but mans miſtake. To confeſs and ſuffer in teſtimony to an error, is to be a falſe-witneſs, not truths witneſs: Pleaders for error, not Pillars of the truth. To add to the profeſſion of error, ſuffering for it, is to add ſin unto ſin: The latter error, worſe then the firſt: Such ſufferers are ſo far ſelfe-vaſſals, not Chriſts Martyrs. Such ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, unto ſpoyling of goods, bonds, exile, the wilderneſs, or whatſoever, are worſe then loſt: a dead birth after ſore travel, is a double wo: Such tears muſt be wept for again: this ungodly ſorrow, is not to be undone without godly ſorrow. We may build, and work; but if it be Wood, Hay, Stubble, we ſhall ſuffer loſs; our work muſt be burnt, though our ſelves be ſaved, yet as by fire.</p>
            <p>The Scripture mentions, <hi>Little children, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, young-men, men, Fathers, and a perfect man in Chriſt:</hi> as concerning your ſelves, unto whom the dreadful bond of office hath endebted me, the weakeſt of many, to make known unto you, the truth of the Goſpel: what hath my ſoul longed, or labored for more, after your birth in Chriſt, then that you ſhould be, not only Babes,
<pb facs="tcp:118295:5"/>but men: both ſound, and ſtrong in the faith: Sincere, and diſtinct: that Chriſt might not only be formed, but perfected. That you might not onely have a ſaving, but a ſatisfactory know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of him, in whom you beleeve? The end of the Goſpel is to be known, the duty and diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Beleever, is to know.</p>
            <p>Even Fundamental Truths which have been the ſame in all generations, have been, and ſhall be tranſmitted more clear from age to age in the times of Reformation: until that which is perfect is come, and that which is imperfect be done away:<note place="margin">Vid. Grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naei praefat locis com. Zeged. prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix. pag. <hi>5.</hi>
               </note> The truth held forth is the ſame; though with more of Chriſt, and leſs of man. Such addition, is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation, but an illuſtration, not new light, but new ſight. The looking glaſs ſlurred and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more or leſs, is the ſame glaſs. <hi>Columbus</hi> did not make a New World, when he made a new diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the old World.</p>
            <p>Truth wants ſo much of its glory, as it is unſeen. The underſtanding wants ſo much of its perfection, as it is ſhort in ſeeing thereof. The Members of the New man, have their joynts: joynts not fully ſet are painful, and leſs uſeful. All unbeleif is preſumption, not faith: which hinders nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and genders humor.</p>
            <p>Grace, Glory, and Glorification, hold pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion with the truth. Though knowledg may be without grace, yet there can be no grace with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowledg. According to the meaſure of our approach, to an exact, total, and Adequate Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of the underſtanding with the truth of the Goſpel: So is the glory of the truth beleeved,
<pb facs="tcp:118295:5"/>and the Communion of the Soul beleeving.</p>
            <p>Men need ſtrong meat, at well as Babes need Milk; though he who is but a Babe, hath not the knowledg of a man, yet he that is a Babe labours after the knowledg of a man. Babes reſt not in being Babes. I have endeavored to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that might entertain the ſtronger, yet ſo as (I hope) I have ſcarce ſaid any thing, that weaker ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities. may not with due attention attain unto. Solid meat that is beſt prepared, is not digeſted without: yet is digeſted with time, and the labor of nature. The Seed which the husbandman ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with pains, the Earth receiveth not without pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. 'Tis the Prerogative of God, 'tis not in the power of man to communicate underſtanding without ſtudy, and diligence: Though it be in Gods power to give, yet according to his ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Diſpenſation, he doth not give knowledg unto man, without labor and prayer; but he giveth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his a ſpirit, by meditating day and night, to ſearch into the deep things of God: Who refuſeth ripe fruit becauſe it groweth higher then can be had without climbing; or the treaſures hid in the Earth becauſe they cannot be had without digging?</p>
            <p>And who knoweth but that theſe poor ſheets may find a place with ſome others, eſpecially in the houſes and hearts of them, of whoſe houſe I am: out of whoſe heart, they cannot be, whilſt I am. That I may not be, as one altogether dead to thoſe, whom I ſhould have been glad to have lived and dyed with; yea whom I ſhould have been glad to have lived and dyed for. My abſence from them, hath named this Wilderneſs, <hi>Gerſom:</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:118295:6"/>their acceptance hereof, ſhall ſo far name it <hi>Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im:</hi> It is with God that knoweth the heart of exiles to comfort exiles.</p>
            <p>'Tis not with me, as with <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> who though he was weak in writing, yet was he able to ſpeak; Nor as with <hi>Albericus,</hi> who though weak in ſpeech, was able in writing; but being contious of my infirmity in both, I have added the latter, to ſupply in ſome meaſure (if God ſo pleaſe) the defect of the former.</p>
            <p>Sometimes <hi>Pauls</hi> writing is more weighty then his ſpeech, and ſome of Chriſts words after his death, were more effectual then in his Life. Hence I have deſired to ſow Seed, both by Pen and Tongue; preſent, and abſent; Alive and dead: Not knowing whether ſhal proſper moſt, either this, or that, or whether they both ſhould be alike good. Good Books help both the underſtanding, and memory. They are both Teachers, and Regiſters, like ſteeled looking-glaſſes; that do not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect, but continue reflecting the Image to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder:<note place="margin">Segnius irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant animes, demiſſa per auros Quam quae ſunt oculis Subjecta ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delibus—</note> The ſpeaker haſteth on, and cannot wait the leaſure of the hearer; but the writer is always at hand, attending the capacity of the Reader. What is ſayd of the poor, with a little alteration, may be applyed to written Treatiſes; <hi>Books you have always with you, you may receive good from them when you will.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Penning and Reading of godly Books, is a ſingular improvement of the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Saints: as whereby we enjoy ſweet and gracious conference with the Saints, though unknown to us, though abſent in place, &amp; diſtant in time (yea many ages before us) and ſo partake in the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of their moſt precious Gifts, as if they were preſent with us, or as if we had been of long acquainted with them, which maketh me ſometimes to wiſh, that though I cannot nor dare not ſay, that Spiritual Gifts are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, when they are only diſpenced in a Pulpit (for in a Pulpit they are ſet upon a Candleſtick, and give light to all that are in the Houſe of this or that particular Church:) yet where God giveth an eminent meaſure of light, fit to ſhine forth to a Nation, or to a world of Churches: That ſuch Gifts might not be confined to a Pulpit; but as cluſters of ripe Grapes paſsing under the preſs, are fit to be tranſported to all Nations; So ſuch Gifts and Labors paſsing under the Preſs, may be fitly Communicated to all Churches. It is indeed a true word which the word of truth hath ſpoken (Eccleſ. <hi>12.12.</hi>) <hi>Of making many books there is no end, and much reading is a wearineſs to the fleſh.</hi> But yet, ſome books there be, of which I may ſay, as <hi>Ferne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> and other Phyſicians ſpeak of their Pills; There are <hi>Pillulae ſine quibus,</hi> that is, <hi>ſine quibus eſſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo;</hi> ſo there be ſome <hi>libelli ſine quibus,</hi> ſome books <hi>ſine quibus eſſe nolo.</hi> And this is one of them, without which I would neither be my ſelf, nor wiſh thee to be. Though moſt books be accommodated to Popular capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city (and they do moſt good extenſively:) yet there
<pb facs="tcp:118295:8"/>had need to be ſome, which ſpeak accurately, that they who apply their Sermons and writings to Popular capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, may ſtill keep within the compaſs of exact Truth: and they do moſt good intenſively.

            <p>There be ſome of good judgment, who interpret the four Creatures (in <hi>Revel. 4.7.</hi>) to hold forth the four ſorts of Officers in the Church: The <hi>Lyon</hi> (for his Courage and Power) the Ruling Elder: The <hi>Ox</hi> (for his patience and labor in treading out the Corn) the Paſtor: The <hi>Man</hi> (for his Prudence in ordering the humane outward affairs of the Church) the Deacon: The <hi>Eagle</hi> (for his ſoaring aloft, and quick in ſight in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to remote, and hidden things) the Teacher. How well therefore doth it become this our Reverend Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Teacher of an intelligent people (the Church at <hi>Ipſwich</hi>) to lanch forth into the deep, (as Chriſt biddeth his Diſciples, Luk. <hi>5.4.</hi>) To ſpie out and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the ſecret and abſtruſe myſteries of the Kingdom of God?</p>
            <p>Moreover that which adorneth the exactneſs of the matter of this diſcourſe, is, Pithy Brevity, compact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as many things as words together; that as it was the conſtant deſire and affectation, and expreſsion of Dr <hi>Preſton,</hi> to live long in a little time; So it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth to be the ſerious care and endeavour of this our beloved Brother, to ſpeak much in few words. The Schoolmen (though they be none of the ſoundeſt Divines)
<pb facs="tcp:118295:8"/>yet of late years, have crept (for a time) into more cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit amongſt Schools, then the moſt judicious and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox of our beſt new writers (<hi>Luther, Calvin, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, Bucer,</hi> and the rest:) and their books were much more vendible, and at a far greater price: But what or wherein lay their preheminence? Not in the light of Divine Grace (whereof moſt of them were wholly deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute) nor in their skill in Tongues and <hi>Polite Lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratur,</hi> (wherein they were <hi>Barbarians:</hi>) nor in their deeper inſight into the holy Scriptures (in which they were far leſs converſant, then in <hi>Peter Lumbard,</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle:</hi>) but in their rational diſputes, with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Solidity and Succinct brevity. But in the mean time they corrupted the whole body of Divinity, with many curious and unprofitable queſtions, with many Philoſophical (falſly ſo called) and vain Notions, and with many ſubtil devices, to uphold the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in their then prevailing Antichriſtian Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. What was unſound and corrupt in the Schoolmen, our Brother (by the guidance of Chriſt) hath faithfully and Religiouſly avoyded: what was commendable and deſireable, he hath (through grace) not ſo much imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated as exceeded: Opening the principal heads of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, with more then rational evidence, even with Scripture light: and all with ſuch diſtinct Solidity, as may both clear the underſtanding, and ſatisfie the Judgment, yea and by grace eſtabliſh the faith of the diligent Reader: and that with ſuch Succinct Brevity, as avoydeth at once both Perplexity, and obſcurity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Amongſt other diſputes which have much exerciſed the Schoolmen of old, and ſtill do buſie the <hi>Dominicans</hi> and <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> concerning the concurſe of Grace, and Free-will therein, the Lord hath led this
<pb facs="tcp:118295:9"/>our Brother with a ſtrong hand to ſearch out, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, the abſtruſe myſteries thereof, with ſuch holy Dexterity, as that if the diſſenting parties were as willing to hearken to the Oracles of God ſpeaking in the Scriptures, and opened in this book, as the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> have often appealed to the <hi>Pope</hi> (and all in vain) for the compounding of this Controverſie, The Doctrines of Grace would be much more clearly delivered and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally accepted, with more peace and truth, not only amongſt them, but amongſt Proteſtants alſo; yea and even ſuch Proteſtants as excell in holineſs and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, and yet ſeem (and but ſeem) to vary (though <hi>Logically,</hi> yet not <hi>Theologically</hi>) in ſome doctrines of Grace, may (through grace) either judg and ſpeak all one thing, or at leaſt condeſcend: <hi>placide ferre con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſentientes,</hi> mildely to bear with difference of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in ſuch a caſe.</p>
            <p>And as for ſuch Proteſtants as follow <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Fevardentius</hi> in extenuating the bitterneſs of the Soul-ſufferings of Chriſt from any ſenſe of ſpiritual Deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (as if ſuch pangs were incompatible to his pure and innocent Nature and Life) I truſt the Lord will give them to diſcern by another book of this Author (treating purpoſely of that Argument) the more bitter the cup was which he drank up for us, the deeper was the guilt of our ſin, and the greater was the meaſure of his Love towards us. And unleſs the whole guilt of our ſins be imputed to him, and his perfect obedience to the Law be imputed to us, we ſhall fall ſhort, both of the matter and form of our juſtification.</p>
            <p>Now the God of all Grace, and Peace, and Truth, bleſs theſe gracious Endevors of his Servant to the free paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of his Truth and Peace in the hearts and Judgments of his Churches and People through our Lord Jeſus.</p>

               <p>So much we ſee of him that we may live, more we cannot ſee of him and live: To ſee him as he is, is reſerved to glory.</p>
               <p>God in his Word revealeth himſelf to be <hi>Iehovah Elohim, i. e.</hi> one God ſubſiſting in three Perſons. Though Eſſence and Subſiſtence, that is, the divine Nature, and the Trinity of Perſons in that Nature, are the ſame thing, they being diſtinguiſhed not as a Being and a Being, but as the manner of a Being or thing is diſtinguiſhed from the Being or thing

               <p>The Eſſence of God abſolutely conſidered, is that one pure and meer act, by which God is God.

               <p>The Hebrew Names more eſpecially tending to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, are obſerved by Authors to be about ten in number.</p>

               <p>The divine Attributes are certain eſſential Properties, which God is pleaſed in Scripture to aſcribe or attribute un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelf; they are alſo called the Perfections of God, or divine Predications, or Titles.</p>
               <p>They are not diſtinguiſhed from the Eſſence really, but notionally; that is, they are not diſtinguiſhed at all in God, but only to us-ward, according to our manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving.</p>
               <p>All the Attributes in God are one and the ſame Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

                  </note> who being unable to comprehend that meer act at once, do conceive thereof after the manner of many acts. The Sun when it is perpendicular, had it an eye would behold all that at once, which we, by reaſon of the inadequateneſs and unpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionableneſs of our ſight, are neceſſitated to view by parts. In God all things are one and the ſame, according to the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118295:11"/>Nature of God; though out of God many, and divers, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their own proper and created nature. The ſame heat in the Sun produceth divers effects, according to the various diſpoſition of the objects: Hardneſs in Clay, ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Wax: Life in Inſects and Plants, &amp;c. The ſame lines are one in the Center, but diſtinguiſhed and multiplyed in the Circumference. Water that is the ſame in the Sea, out of the Sea is variouſly and diverſly qualified, ſweet, bitter, Sulphureous, &amp;c. The matter in the Liver is the ſame, but the four humors of Blood, Choller, Melancholy, and Flegm, that proceed from thence, are very divers: The Soul which is one and the ſame produceth very differing effects, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the operations of the underſtanding, will, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. The ſum is: The Attributes, as was ſaid before, are not diſtinguiſhed in God, that is, from the divine Eſſence, or one from another really, but only notionally, or virtually in our conception, and in their objects, in reſpect of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious effects thereupon: For every and all the Attributes are the divine Eſſence it ſelf; according to that received Propoſition,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Whatſoever is in God, is God:</hi> And this is the reaſon why ſome well deſcribe the Attributes from the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God: which manner of deſcription, beſides many uſeful notions clearly intimated thereby, doth in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing of the Relative Attributes, principle and fortifie the underſtanding againſt that perilous Tenet of Arminianiſm, concerning the Decree paſſing upon good or bad foreſeen, with the evil conſequences following thereupon.</p>

The more principal of them are in number five, <hi>viz.</hi> Simplicity, Eternity, Immenſity, Immutability, Infiniteneſs: to which, or ſome of which, any other of like nature may conveniently be referred.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:118295:11"/>Simplicity is God, one meer and perfect act without all compoſition.

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſpirits are immixt in reſpect of bodies, to ſhew that he is not compounded, he ſaith he <hi>is a Spirit, Iohn.</hi> 4.24. When we ſay that God is a meer and perfect Act, the meaning is, that God is a Cauſe without any Cauſe, a Being that is not from any Being; not compounded of an Act, by which he is; and Poſſibility, by which he might not have been, or may not be: of whom it never could nor can be ſaid, that any thing was to be in him, which was not; or cannot be, that is.</p>
               <p>That God is a pure and ſimple Act without all compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is evident, Becauſe of his Perfection; all compoſition ſuppoſeth imperfection, becauſe he is the firſt Being. Were there any compoſition in God, it would follow there were firſt and ſecond in God: Something in God that were not firſt, or that there were more firſt Beings.</p>
               <p>Becauſe God is a Being of abſolute neceſſity:<note place="margin">Deus eſt ens neceſſe eſſe. <hi>Smiſing</hi> de Deo uno. <hi>tr. 2. diſp. 2. n. 49.</hi>
                  </note> Compoſition implyeth either that there muſt be more Beings of abſolute neceſſity, or that there is ſomething in God that may not be. Compoſition ſuppoſeth Succeſſion, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſomething paſt or to come in God; contrary to his Name, <hi>I am.</hi> Nay it ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth that not-being is not repugnant to the Nature of God: Where there is Compoſition, there may be Diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Diſſolution is the way to not-being. It much helps us in the contemplation of the Simplicity of God, to look upon it as oppoſed to Compoſition, all the ways whereof the Learned have referred to theſe ſeven Heads.</p>

God is no where, and God is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where: he is no where, in that he is not contained any where; he is every where, in that he containeth all: Hence God, in reſpect of his Omnipreſence, is compared to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Point. God is in every place by his Eſſence, as the univerſal Cauſe of the Being and operation of all things; by his Preſence, beholding all things; and by his Power, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding all things.</p>
               <p>Beſides that Omnipreſence of God, whereby he is always preſent with all creatures, there are certain peculiar ways of his preſence with divers creatures. In Chriſt he dwelleth bodily, that is, perſonally, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.9. and filleth the Manhood with the Spirit out of meaſure, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.34. In the Saints he dwelleth as in his Temple by the preſence of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling Spirit, the effect of his ſpecial grace, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16. He is ſaid to dwell in Heaven, becauſe it is the place where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he is pleaſed to manifeſt his glory immediately, and in moſt excellent manner unto the bleſſed. God is ſaid to come to us, and depart from us, not in reſpect of his univerſal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, or change of place; but in reſpect of the degrees of his in-dwelling Spirit, aſſiſting grace, and other ſpecial ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of his favour towards his people: The ſame alſo holds true, in reſpect of the common effects of the Spirit, in regard of others.</p>
               <p>Bodies are in places circumſcriptively, bounded by their dimenſions, without penitration. Angels are in places defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitively; that is, though they are not bounded by dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of height, bredth and depth, as bodies; yet they are not in two places at once; whileſt they are in this place, they are not in another.

                  </note> is evident from the nature of God, who willeth his own being freely. If he were ſubject to co-action and mutability, he were not God. If by reaſon of our weakneſs we are leſs able ſo diſtinctly to diſcern the liberty of God, as concerning the creature in the act of God willing; yet it is clearly to be ſeen in the object willed, <hi>viz.</hi> the creature: becauſe nothing is more manifeſt then that there is no neceſſary connexion between the being of God, and the being thereof. God had been the ſame, perfect and bleſſed for ever, though the creature had never been.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Such ſpeeches though ſpoken after the manner of men for the help of our underſtanding: yet, are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood as becometh the nature of God. God is therefore ſaid to repent, becauſe he doth as men do when they repent, that is, he changeth his deeds: yet without any change of his will. Nay, thoſe changes of his deeds are the executions of his unchangeable will.</p>
               <p>Infiniteneſs is God of univerſal, unlimited, and incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible

What is there ſaid of one attribute, is true of all. God receiveth not his being of any, but hath it of himſelf: yea, he is his own being, therefore illimited; for there is none to limit him. God willeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf freely, yet neceſſarily; that which acts neceſſarily, acts with all its might. God therefore having all perfection in his own power, cannot deny any to himſelf.</p>
               <p>All things are contained in God: that which is increated, eſſentially; that which is created, to be created, or poſſible to be created, eminently; God is all. <hi>He is of every name, yet above all name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The more principal Relative Attributes are in number,<note place="margin">Relative Attributes.</note> ſeven. 1. Creation. 2. Providence. 3. Lordſhip. 4. Benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. 5. Mercy. 6. Redemption. 7. Juſtice. To which, or ſome of which, the reſt of like nature may conveniently be referred.</p>
               <p>Though the terms Creator, Governor, Redeemer, and Lord, do more clearly hold forth the relation between God and the creature: yet (after others) the fore-named terms are here made uſe of: both as ſufficiently containing the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and better conducing to teach the Doctrine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
               <p>A new Relative Attribute or Praedication doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes preſuppoſe a change in that thing unto which that new relation is given, though it alwayes preſuppoſeth a change in that whereunto ſuch relation doth really belong: for example ſake, <hi>Peter</hi> may ſit at the right hand of <hi>John,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any change in <hi>Peter,</hi> the change being only in <hi>John,</hi> who placeth himſelf at <hi>Peters</hi> left hand. The Princes are ſaid to ſtand on the right hand of the wall, <hi>Neh.</hi> 12.31. without any change in the wall, the change was only in them ſo placing themſelves. So God who was not a Creator from eternity, is a Creator in time: yet this new appellation puts no change in God, but only in the creature. The ſecond Perſon who was not incarnate from eternity, becometh incarnate in the fulneſs of time, yet without any change: the change was, and is only in the humane nature aſſumed, not in the divine
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:118295:14"/>nature aſſuming. In theſe Relative Attributes, (the Creator being above the order of the creature) the extreams not being alike: the relation is not alike. The relation on Gods part is only a relation of Reaſon: that is, ſuch a reſpect of the Creator to the creature, as is without any change in him: but on the creatures part, it is a real relation: that is, ſuch a relation as inferreth a change in it.</p>
               <p>Relative Attributes adde a new predication, or title to, but cauſe no real mutation, or change in God: as concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the creature they both add a new predication to it, and cauſe a real mutation in it.</p>
               <p>In all Relative Attributes, there are conſiderable (but eſpecially in Creation, Providence, and Redemption) an eternal immanent act, whereby God willeth ſuch a thing to be; and a tranſient temporal act, whereby he worketh the thing according to his will.</p>
               <p>Creation (whence God hath the Title of a Creator) is a tranſient act, whereby God according to his will, created all things of nothing very good.</p>
               <p>Providence (whence God hath the Title of Governour) conſiſts in thoſe acts whether permanent or tranſient, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by according to his will, he preſerveth and governeth all things with the circumſtances thereof, unto their ſeveral ends, for his own glory, and the good of the elect.</p>
               <p>Lordſhip is Gods having abſolute right and power to, and over all his creatures, and diſpoſing thereof according to his will, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.18. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.13. <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.15. <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.25.</p>
               <p>Abſolute Soveraignty is due unto God by four Titles: Of Creation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.20. Of Conſervation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. To give the creature to continue in being, is more then meerly to give it being: as the ſhadow dependeth upon the body, ſo the creature dependeth upon the Creator. Of Redemption, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20. this exceeds both the former. Of the laſt end, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.4. The end of the creature is the manifeſtation of the glory of the Creator.</p>
               <p>Lordſhip is in God after the moſt eminent manner: he hath Subjects of himſelf, Authority of himſelf, Legiſlative
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:118295:15"/>Power of himſelf. He appoints the rule with recompence to the obedient, and puniſhment to the diſobedient accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his meer good pleaſure. He is his own rule, his will is the moſt abſolute reaſon. He giveth no account of his mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>Job</hi> 33.13. Every creature dependeth eſſentially and univerſally upon the Creator: that is, the creature cannot be, but it muſt be at the diſpoſing of God. We do not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge our ſelves to be creatures, nor God to be Lord, if his pleaſure be not acknowledged to be a ſufficient and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory reaſon, of whatſoever he doth.</p>
               <p>The Lordſhip of God is of himſelf, not by occupation, as a Title of Property, ariſing from a thing found with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an owner; nor by Donation, Succeſſion, Purchaſe, or Conqueſt, as created Lordſhips are. All created Juriſdiction deſcendeth from this abſolute Lordſhip of God. The Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction that Chriſt as man received from God is univerſal over all the creatures reſpectively, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.18. The Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of other men is limited according to the ſeveral ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects thereof: whether Eccleſiaſtical, where their Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Office is immediately received from Chriſt though the deſignation of ſuch perſons to ſuch offices be by the call of men. Or civil, whether natural, as parent, and child: Or voluntary, as Magiſtrate, and Subject.</p>

The Sun, if compared with other creatures, you may ſay (in that reſpect) it hath light of it ſelf, but the Moon and Stars are light by participation: that is, they receive their light from
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:118295:15"/>the Sun. God is a full Fountain, or rather a Fountain which is fulneſs it ſelf; willing to communicate, as the Sun ſends forth its light, a fountain its ſtreams, and the prolifical virtue in plants, inclineth them to fruitfulneſs; as the ſeminal vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in living creatures, diſpoſeth them to generation: the peculiar affection in parents towards their children, renders them propenſe to do them good: and the ſoul full of matter (like wine which hath no vent) propends to pour out it ſelf; ſo is the Lord affected to do good according as he hath willed concerning the creature.</p>
               <p>The goodneſs communicated from God unto the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is either ſpecial, beſtowed upon Angels and men: Or common, beſtowed upon the reſt of the Creation: <hi>The Earth is full of the goodneſs of the Lord, Pſal.</hi> 33.5.

               <p>Mercy is increated, <hi>viz.</hi> the Attribute of God: or crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>viz.</hi> a tranſient act of God in time, or the effects of ſuch tranſient acts: ſo Vocation is ſaid to be an act of mercy, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.30, 32. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.10.</p>
               <p>Remiſſion of ſin, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.78. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.33. Salvation, <hi>Jude</hi> 21. Increated mercy is Gods will to ſhew mercy. Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated mercy is Gods actual ſhewing mercy according to his will.</p>
               <p>The Effects of Mercy, are either ſpecial: proper to the Elect, as flowing from ſpecial grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.23. The Elect are called (and by effectual calling ſo made) <hi>veſſels of mercy.</hi> Or common, extended to thoſe who are not elected, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.35, 36. <hi>

               <p>Redemption is that whereby God gave his Son; and Jeſus Chriſt God-man gave himſelf, and accordingly in due time became a Ranſom for the Elect: whence it cometh to paſs, That Juſtice is no hinderance to the application of Mercy, <hi>John</hi> 3.16. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.26.</p>
               <p>Creation, Providence, and Redemption, conſidered as they are in God, <hi>i. e.</hi> as immanent acts, belong unto Gods ſufficiency, and may be placed amongſt his Attributes; but if they be looked at as tranſient acts, <hi>i. e.</hi> as acts paſſing, and done in time; ſo they belong unto Gods Efficiency, and are placed amongſt the works of God.</p>
               <p>Though God by his abſolute Power might have ſaved man without Redemption wrought by Chriſt: yet having conſtituted that Rule of relative Juſtice, <hi>In the day that thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely dye, Gen.</hi> 2.17. He could not
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:118295:16"/>in reſpect of his Power now limited to proceed by this rule, ſo that man having ſinned, man muſt dye, and ſatisfie the Law that man may live. Juſtice requireth the Surety ſhould dye, that the Debtor may live: <hi>That he might be juſt, and the juſtifier of him which believeth in Jeſus, Rom.</hi> 3.26.</p>
               <p>Juſtice is, God willing, to render unto the reaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture what is due thereunto according to his word: whether by way of grace, or puniſhment, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.4. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.16. 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.11, 12.</p>
               <p>Juſtice in God is either eſſential of the abſolute nature of God; whence it is, that God can do no wrong. To be in God eſſentially, is to be in God by neceſſity of nature: that is, it is of the neceſſary Being of God, ſo as if God is, that is, and if that were not, God were not. Or Relative: <hi>viz.</hi> The Juſtice of God in reſpect of the creature; that is, in God neceſſarily. This is in him freely, and is nothing elſe but Gods conſtant will to give unto the creature what is its due. The Will of God is the Rule of Juſtice. That which Gods Law is unto man, that is Gods Will unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Juſtice conſiſting in rendering to every one their due; and Gods Will being the Rule of Juſtice; it followeth, that and only that to be due unto man, which God hath willed concerning him. The Moral Law it ſelf, the Rule of Manners, the Recompence contained in the Promiſe in caſe of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the Puniſhment contained in the Curſe in caſe of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience: are all the effects of Gods free pleaſure.</p>
               <p>It being a truth, That Gods Will is the Rule of Juſtice between him and the creature: and conſequently, That the deſert and puniſhment of ſin determined by him is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore juſt, becauſe he hath ſo determined. It followeth, that in caſe God had appointed a greater puniſhment, it had been juſt the damned ſhould have ſuffered more: And in caſe he had appointed a leſſer puniſhment, it had been juſt they ſhould have ſuffered leſs.</p>
               <p>Though the Rule of relative Juſtice be a free conſtitution, yet God having conſtituted this rule, hath freely obliged himſelf to the obſervation thereof; and can now no more fail to execute juſtice according to this rule, then he can be unjuſt.</p>

Holineſs. 2. Wiſdom. 3. Will. 4. Liberty. 5. Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency. 6. Perfection. To which, or ſome of which, the reſt of like nature may conveniently be referred.</p>
               <p>Holineſs is God, <hi>conformable to himſelf,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.13. As created holineſs (which ſome call moral goodneſs or perfection of manners) is the conformity of the reaſonable creature to the Rule; ſo (God being his own Rule, and the Fountain of all created perfection) we may conceive of increated holineſs, as of Gods Conformity unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>God is holy eſſentially, and ſo is none but he, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. There is none holy as the Lord, the creature is holy only by participation. He is the Authour of all created holineſs; both of the Moral Law, which is the rule of holineſs; and of the infuſed grace of holineſs, whence the reaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is made conformable to that rule, and of all other holineſs whatſoever: therefore juſtly called, <hi>the Holy One of Iſrael, Iſai.</hi> 41.20. Wiſdom is, God underſtanding all things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible by his Eſſence, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Acts</hi> 15.18. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.20.</p>
               <p>God comprehending his own Eſſence, ſeeth all things; becauſe all Poſſibilities, Futuritions, and Beings; that is, all things that might have been, ſhall be, or actually be, are eminently contained in the Divine Eſſence. Whence, by the way it may appear, That the Divine Eſſence as willing the futurition of things, is that increated <hi>Idea</hi> of all things: which God comprehending, underſtandeth the creature bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in himſelf, then it is to be underſtood in it ſelf. God ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf, ſeeth all things, without exemption of any; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, without intermiſſion; perfectly, without defect: at once, without ſucceſſion. He is all eye, yet without an eye: all memory, yet without a memory.</p>
               <p>God underſtandeth all things by his Eſſence, Angels are
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:118295:17"/>thought to underſtand by an infuſed habit of the ſpecies, or images of things concreated with their nature. Men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand by the Species, or Images of things abſtracted, and received from their objects.</p>
               <p>Men underſtand by way of ſyllogiſtical diſcourſe, <hi>viz.</hi> by reaſoning; that is, by deducing and gathering concluſions from principles by ſeveral acts of their underſtanding: and by compounding and dividing: that is, by laying the ſubject and predicate together, or by taking them aſunder: and thereby collecting what may be ſaid, or not ſaid truly concerning ſuch a ſub-ject.</p>
               <p>Thoſe truths which men by reaſon of the weakneſs of their underſtanding, apprehend not without diſcourſe,<note place="margin">Tho. Part. <hi>1.</hi> qu. <hi>58.</hi> Art. <hi>3.</hi> &amp; <hi>4.</hi> Polan. Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tag. <hi>l. 5. c. 11.</hi>
                  </note> and by compounding and dividing: Angels by reaſon of the quickneſs and ſtrength of their underſtanding, apprehend readily, and as it were at firſt ſight. Whence albeit they underſtand ſyllogiſtical diſcourſe, compoſition, and diviſion, yet (at leaſt compared with men) they may be ſaid not to underſtand by diſcourſe, nor by compoſition and diviſion, but intuitively; and as it were at firſt ſight.</p>
               <p>The Will of God, is God by one ſimple act, abſolutely willing, the being of whatſoever he pleaſeth.</p>
               <p>That Diſtinction of the Abſolute and Conditional Will, as alſo that of the Antecedent, and Conſequent Will of God, are both unſound. God willeth it to be a truth, <hi>That whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever believeth ſhall be ſaved:</hi> he likewiſe willeth it to be the duty of <hi>Judas</hi> to believe: Hence followeth (in caſe) A Will of Approbation concerning things in their own nature poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, which yet never ſhall be: as namely, the acceptation of the obedience of the Reprobates; but it doth not follow that God hath conditionally willed the acceptation of the obedience of the Reprobates. God decreeth the coexiſtence of two extreams conditionally cohering, as the faith and ſalvation of <hi>Judas,</hi> the ſight of ſuch miracles and repentance in the <hi>Tyrians:</hi> the Being of which Extreams themſelves he hath not decreed. Though the things willed be conditioned, yet the Volition or Willing of God concerning thoſe things is abſolute.</p>

By the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Will of God, they underſtand his Will concerning the creature looked at, not only as in it ſelf, but together with after-adjuncts and circumſtances, as ſin, &amp;c. This they call his ſecond Will, and it is, ſay they, certain. As a Judge looking upon ſuch a perſon as in himſelf, accounteth it beſt that he ſhould live; but looking upon him in ſecond re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, as a Murtherer, &amp;c. he accounts it beſt that he ſhould dye.</p>
               <p>The vanity of both theſe Diſtinctions appeareth, in that they are repugnant to the ſimplicity, perfection, and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance of the firſt cauſe. The Will of God in the Decree, and the revealing of part thereof in the Command, do not infer divers wills in God: The Command ſheweth what is the duty of man, the Decree contains Gods purpoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our doing, or not doing our duty: To will ſuch a thing ought to be, and not to will that it ſhall be; yea to will the not being thereof, are not oppoſite, but both may, and do proceed from the ſame will.</p>

               <p>Though nothing be more manifeſt then that God willeth freely, and not neceſſarily, whatſoever is beſides himſelf: yet the manner of his willing thereof, exceedeth our capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities.</p>
               <p>Created Acts of Liberty being limited, and bounded by their objects, cannot tend unto divers objects, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out tending to divers acts: but increated Liberty being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, is illimited by its objects; and tends unto divers ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects by one and the ſame act.</p>
               <p>Increated Liberty, is not to be looked at, as conſiſting in
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:118295:18"/>an indifferency to divers acts of willing, or nilling: For that would argue imperfection in God: but it is clearly ſeen in reſpect of its divers created objects, which as they have their being from Gods good pleaſure; ſo, had he ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, they had never been: but continued for ever in their nothing; himſelf notwithſtanding eternal, all bleſſed, and all glorious.</p>
               <p>Omnipotency is God able to do whatſoever his wiſdom doth conceive, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.14. <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.26. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 46.10.</p>
               <p>All Contradictions, Impoſſibilities, and Repugnancies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the revealed Will of God, are excluded in this Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: God is Omnipotent, or God can do all things. That, things which imply a contradiction: as namely, for the ſame thing to be, and not to be; and impoſſibilities, as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for a man not to be a reaſonable creature, and the like: fall not under the compaſs of Omnipotency, is not from any defect (it is indeed from the perfection) of power in God; but from the impoſſibility of the things: ſo that concerning matters of this nature, it is more convenient to ſay,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nde conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nientius dr: Ea non poſſunt fieri, quam quod Deus ea non poſſit facere. Tho. Part. qu. <hi>25.</hi> art. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> that they cannot be, which ſheweth their non-poſſibility to be, then that God cannot do them; which ſeemeth to touch upon Omnipotency. So likewiſe that God cannot ſin, lye, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny himſelf, is not from defect, but from the Eminency of his Power, and Abſolute Perfection, whence he is uncapable of being touched with any imperfection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> God cannot deſtroy <hi>Sodom,</hi> until <hi>Lot</hi> be gone out of it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.22. Like ſpeeches whereunto are uſed elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, it ſeems therefore God is not Omnipotent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Power of God is either abſolute, and unlimited; by it he is able to do all things that are poſſible, though he never do them: or ordinate, and limited by his Decree, and revealed Will: according to which God having freely bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf, changeth not, being immutable. Theſe words, and the like ſpoken elſewhere, are to be underſtood of his limited, not of his unlimited power. Though God be Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent, yet he is not Omnivolent; that is, though God can do whatſoever he pleaſeth, yet God is not pleaſed to do whatſoever he can.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:118295:19"/>Perfection is God all-ſufficient, and all-excellent: not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving need of any thing, giving ſufficience unto, and having in him the perfection of all things, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1, 2. <hi>Exod.</hi> 6.3. This Attribute renders God as that infinite Sea of all hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,</p>
               <p>Perfection is increated Glory: that is, all the Attributes in one word; as Happineſs is the Sum of Mans good, ſo Glory is the Sum of all Gods Attributes. The Perfection of God is Eſſential, Independent, Unlimited, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, or decreaſe: As the Power of ſubordinate cauſes is contained in the firſt cauſe virtually: and as the Authority of Under-Officers is in the Prince after a more excellent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; ſo the virtue of all ſecond cauſes is contained in the firſt cauſe eminently.</p>
               <p>The word <hi>Eminently</hi> taken in its ſtrict and proper ſence, ſeemeth to intend the effect to be in the cauſe, not only in a more excellent manner then in it ſelf, but alſo in a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created manner. Things are in God agreeable to the Nature of God: in themſelves according to their proper natures.</p>
               <p>Eminential Continency, and Virtual Continency, (that is, for one thing to be contained in another eminently, as the Excellency of the creature is in the Creator: Or Virtually, as all things ſaleable are in money, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10.9.) are not the ſame: the firſt is proper to the Creator, the ſecond is found in the creature.</p>
               <p>The Eſſential Perfection of God, is Increated Glory, Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, alwayes the ſame; from which nothing can be taken, to which nothing can be added.

By others, that it is an incommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Exiſtence of an intellectual Nature. By later Writers, that it is an individual, or ſingular Being, ſubſiſting, living, underſtanding, incommunicable; not ſuſtained of another, not a part of another. The Sum is, that the term <hi>Perſon,</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying that which is moſt perfect in the whole reaſonable Nature, whether Angels, or men; it is aptly uſed to expreſs the Subſiſtences of the Divine Nature, which is of abſolute perfection: which aptneſs of a created, to expreſs an incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated perſon, notwithſtanding: Obſerve yet theſe differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces between them: Every created perſon hath a diſtinct eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence from another. Two created perſons, whether Angels, or men; have two diſtinct, particular, and individual Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or Natures, though they have the ſame general Eſſence: But all the increated perſons have the ſame Eſſence, <hi>John</hi> 10.30. One created perſon hath not his in-being in another, but one increated perſon is in another, <hi>John</hi> 14.10. One created perſon proceeds from another in time: but amongſt the increated perſons, though there be an Eternal Order of their Original one from another, yet there is no priority of Time, Duration, or Nature; the one being God, the other a creature: we muſt always remember that in applying the term <hi>Perſon</hi> by way of ſimilitude unto God, we remove from him all imperfection.</p>
               <p>In that the Subſiſtences in the Divine Nature are Relative, Hence it follows, that innaſcibility, that is, not to be begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, or not to be of another, which is a Property of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, doth not conſtitute a perſon, and ſo of any other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties that are not relative. In that the Subſiſtences in the Divine Nature are individuating; hence it follows that the active Spiration, or Breathing of the Holy Ghoſt, by the Father, and the Son; though it be Relative, (for breathing and breathed are Relates) yet it doth not conſtitute a perſon, becauſe it is not proper to either perſon, but common to both: 'Tis a Relation, but not a Relative Property.</p>

               <p>Negative Notions, as Innaſcibility, &amp;c. cannot conſtitute a perſon, becauſe a perſon is that which is poſitive Negative pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties ſuppoſe a perſon conſtituted, but they do not conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a perſon: they are incommunicable properties, but ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary, not of themſelves: being founded in a poſitive pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, that is, in perſonality. They are founded in this, that there cannot be more proceſſions of the ſame nature: <hi>i. e.</hi> there can be but one Paternity, one Filiation, one Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Divine Nature.</p>
               <p>Spiration, or Breathing, is not a property: being common both to the Father, and the Son: Paternity, Filiation, and Proceeding, are conſidered as relative properties; ſo they conſtitute the perſons: or as meer properties, that is, not conſtituting the perſons; only notifying their diſtinction, and Order of Original; and ſo looked at, they are alſo call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Notions.</p>

                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 3. The Holy Ghoſt is ſaid to proceed from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>John</hi> 15.26. but no where is he ſaid to proceed from the Son; therefore it may ſeem he proceeds not from the Son, and conſequently not from the Father and the Son.</p>

               <p>The Miſſion, or ſending of one perſon from another, is the determination of one perſon by another unto their ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, concerning the creature according to the order of their ſubſiſtence: As the Son in regard of the Order of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is of the Father, ſo doth he depend upon the Father in regard of the Order of his operation. <hi>The Son can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of himſelf, but what he ſeeth the Father do, John</hi> 5.19. And as the Holy Ghoſt in reſpect of the Order of his Being, is of the Father, and the Son: ſo doth he depend upon the Father, and the Son, in reſpect of the Order of his Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Hence as the Son is of the Father, ſo in this ſence he is ſaid to be <hi>ſent from the Father, John</hi> 5.24.30. And as the <hi>Holy Ghoſt is from the Father, and the Son,</hi> ſo he is ſaid to be <hi>ſent from the Father, and the Son, John</hi> 14.26. and 15.26.</p>
               <p>The Eſſence of the three Perſons is the ſame, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.7.<note place="margin">To <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Doctrine of the Trinity.</note> 
                  <hi>John</hi> 10.30. The manner of the Exiſtence, or Eſſence, (though as a perſonal property it be incommunicable) is communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in reſpect of its Original from one perſon to another. The Father is not without the Son, the Son is of the Father, the Holy Ghoſt is of the Father, and the Son.

And here we may ſee the reaſon of thoſe words of Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 8.19. <hi>If you had known me, ye ſhould have known my Father alſo: he that hath ſeen me, hath ſeen the Father.</hi>

               <p>Moreover, The Knowledge of the Trinity is neceſſary to ſalvation; becauſe ſaving faith hath for its object God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, and Jeſus Chriſt God-man. No man is ſaved without the knowledge of the Father: <hi>No
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:118295:25"/>man hath ſeen God at any time; the only begotten Son which is in the boſome of the Father, he hath declared him, John</hi> 1.18.

God heareth none but ſuch as call upon him in the Name of Chriſt: none can call upon God in Chriſt, but ſuch as are taught and aſſiſted by his Spirit.</p>
               <p>We cannot worſhip God aright without the knowledge of the Trinity. As God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, is of the object of faith; ſo is he of the object of divine worſhip.

               <p>All obedience is to be performed unto God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt.

               <p>The Plurality of perſons in the Trinity, is of great uſe for the confirmation of the truth unto us. <hi>John</hi> aſſerts that

Neither ſoul nor body did ever ſubſiſt in themſelves, but from the firſt inſtant of their Creation they ſubſiſted in the ſecond Perſon of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> without ſeparation of one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from another. There was no ceſſation of the Perſonal Union during the time of Chriſts death, no not whileſt his body lay in the grave.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, It was ſubſtantial; the ſubſtance of the Manhood was united to the ſubſtance of the Divine Nature, ſubſiſting in the ſecond Perſon.</p>
               <p>Jeſus Chriſt, God-man, is, as we ſaw before, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of the Eſſential Works of God, that Miracle of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles: ſuch as God never made before, nor ever will make the like again.</p>
               <p>Unto this Perſon God-man, (Man that in our nature he might ſuffer for us, and God that his ſufferings might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come effectual unto us) thus fitted for the greateſt ſervice by the union of both created and increated excellency in him: The <hi>Father</hi> committed the work of Mediation, which was readily and freely accepted by the <hi>Son;</hi> thereby under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking by Bond of Covenant, and Virtue of Office, the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute meriting for, and application unto the Elect; the freedom from all the evil of the curſe, and the fruition of all the good of the promiſe; Satisfaction and Merit are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Office of Chriſt formally, and Efficacy is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained therein virtually.</p>
               <p>Chriſt is Mediatour, not as man alone, nor as God alone; but as God-man. As God-man he is a Middle-perſon, and conſequently a fit Mediatour between God and man, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 7.14. <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.23. As God-man, <hi>he became of no reputation, Philp.</hi> 2.7, 8, 9. As God-man, <hi>he was a Prophet, Deut.</hi> 18.15. <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.27. A <hi>Prieſt, John</hi> 10.17, 18. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. A <hi>King, Acts</hi> 2.36. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.33. As God-man, <hi>he overcame death for us, Heb.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Reconciled us, Rom.</hi> 5.10, 11. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.21, 22. <hi>Entered into Heaven for us, Heb.</hi> 4.14. &amp; 6.20. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:118295:29"/>Therefore he is Mediatour as God-man, not as man alone, nor as God alone.</p>
               <p>The Lord Jeſus took not this honour upon himſelf, but was called thereunto by the Father: hence he is ſaid to be preo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20. fore-appointed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. Elect of God, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 42.1.

This Call of the Lord Jeſus unto office, includes election on the Fathers part, and acceptation on the Mediator's part: and is ſet down after the manner of a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual tranſaction between God and Chriſt; whereby he was deſigned thereunto, as it were by way of Covenant. <hi>If his ſoul ſhall ſet it ſelf an offering for ſin</hi> (for ſo according to the Original do good Authors read the text) <hi>he ſhall ſee his ſeed, he ſhall prolong his dayes, and the pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand, Iſai.</hi> 53.10.</p>
               <p>As Chriſt ſince the incarnation, is a Mediatour incarnate, ſo before the incarnation he was Mediatour to be incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. He was deſigned and accepted to be Mediatour from Eternity: <hi>Jeſus Chriſt yeſterday, and to day, and for ever, Heb.</hi> 13.8. He was declared, and declaratively accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be Mediatour preſently after the fall, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. Hence it was as free and entire unto God, to ſave thoſe that dyed before the incarnation, for the ſake of a Mediatour to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate; as it is to ſave thoſe that dyed ſince the incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for the ſake of a Mediatour actually incarnate. Though Chriſt was not actually ſlain until his paſſion, yet he was virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally incarnate, &amp; ſlain (that is in God's Decree and acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) from the Foundation of the world, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.8. Therefore he muſt needs be a Mediatour from the foundation of the world.</p>
               <p>The Parts of this Office are three: <hi>viz.

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:118295:30"/>as a Prieſt, but as yet un-applyed; he applyed, and applyeth as a King.</p>

                  <item>2. In reſpect of the Manner of the actual Diſpenſation of Salvation made known by him as a Prophet; procured by him as a Prieſt; applyed by him as a King.</item>
                  <item>3. In reſpect of the Manner of the Execution of his Office: he taught as a Prophet, he ſuffered as a Prieſt, he entered into Heaven as a King.</item>

Nor doth he puniſh ſin to the uttermoſt of his power; the torment of hell might have been greater then it is: both which properties are inſeperable from ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Agents. As the Sun becauſe it ſhineth neceſſarily, it ſhineth always, and ſhineth with all its might: fire, becauſe it burneth neceſſarily, (having a fit matter) it burneth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:118295:30"/>and with all its force. The puniſhment of ſin, then being the effect of his pleaſure; it followeth, had he ſo pleaſed, there might have been no puniſhment of ſin at all.</p>
               <p>But God for the Manifeſtation of the Glory of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, in a way tempered with juſtice, having conſtituted this way of ſatisfaction to his relative Juſtice, and the ſalvation of the Elect: his power, in it ſelf abſolute, being now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined unto ſuch an Order of proceeding, by the Act of his own free good pleaſure: As it is impoſſible that any ſhould be ſaved but the Elect, ſo it is impoſſible that any of them ſhould be ſaved, but by the <hi>Man Chriſt Jeſus, Acts</hi> 4.12. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.39.42.44.</p>
               <p>From the Premiſes it is clear, That Chriſt, together with his Office, Acceptation, Merit, and Efficacy thereof,<note place="margin">Mediatorens agere conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit Divinae Naturae, non ut naturae ſed ut tali mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do exiſtenti, qui modus non convenit Patri, aut Filio.

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The word <hi>Man</hi> is not taken in this place in an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted ſence, for the humane nature alone; but in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete ſence, ſignifying the Perſon, and Nature: (yea both natures) together. As the word <hi>God</hi> is uſed, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. not in an abſtracted ſence, for the divine Nature, which hath no blood; but in a concrete ſenſe, noting the Perſon with both Natures, <hi>viz.</hi> divine, and humane. With as good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon we may conclude, That Chriſt, according to the humane nature alone, forgiveth ſin, (which who yeildeth not to be an untruth?) Becauſe we read, <hi>The Son of man hath power to forgive ſin, Matth.</hi> 9.6. The Apoſtle here ſheweth, that man (though no other man, but the <hi>Man Chriſt Jeſus</hi>) is Mediatour: thereby admoniſhing us in our prayers, not to leave out any ſorts of men: becauſe Chriſt our Saviour is held forth as taking upon him the nature of man, not this or that ſort of men,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 5. If Chriſt as God-man be Mediatour, then the Divine Nature ſubſiſting in the relation of the Son, received the Office of Mediatour: and conſequently, ſomething may be added to God: but nothing can be added unto God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is perfection it ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Divine Nature received not the Office, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in it ſelf, but in reſpect of its voluntary diſpenſation; as accepting of ſubſiſtence with the humane nature: that is, Chriſt received and ſuſtained, and ſuſtaineth the Office of Mediatour, not as God alone, nor as man alone, but as God-man. The divine Nature in reſpect of its voluntary diſpenſation; the humane Nature properly. To the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, there is not added any thing, only a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:118295:32"/>but to the humane Nature,<note place="margin">

                  </note> there is added a real change.</p>
               <p>The Properties of either Nature of the Mediatour, are attributed to the whole Perſon in the Concrete by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of properties: becauſe that which is proper to either nature, is neceſſarily true of the Perſon ſubſiſting with both natures.</p>
               <p>Albeit the Mediatorly Office of Chriſt reſpects only the Elect, yet the Majeſty of Chriſt (and that as man) extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it ſelf unto the whole Creation: <hi>Thou haſt crowned him with glory and honour, and haſt given him Dominion over the works of thy hands, and haſt put all things in ſubjection under his feet, Heb.</hi> 2.7, 8, 9. God hath given to the <hi>Man Chriſt Jeſus</hi> a Lordſhip and Governing Power over the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.18. A Lordſhip, and Governing-power over the Reprobate, both Angels and men, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.10.

As concerning the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Kingdom of God, and of the Man Chriſt Jeſus, are of equal extent: Hence their Attributes in that reſpect are alike. God is ſaid to be the <hi>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.15. And <hi>Chriſt hath on his veſture, and on his thigh, a Name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.

               <p n="3">3. In reſpect of the Intenſneſs of it: it is in him in the higheſt degree, in the utmoſt, as much as is poſſible to be in a creature: both negatively, it could not be exceeded: and poſitively, none was equal unto it. The Soul of Chriſt doth not only eminently contain, but exceedeth all the grace that is in Men and Angels.</p>

               <p n="3">3. Created Power: As Chriſt received the Spirit out of meaſure, ſo the Created Power of Chriſt, was, and is out of meaſure. The power of working miracles was in Chriſt as man, conſtantly, and permanently; after the manner of an habit, in which regard he exceeded the power of working miracles, which was in the Prophets, and Saints; who could not work miracles at their pleaſure, but at times: Divine Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance (occaſionally) enabling of them thereunto.

               <p n="4">4. Created Knowledge, The Knowledge that is in Chriſt, is either increated, or created: Increated is that which is in him as God; whereby <hi>he knoweth all things, John</hi> 2.25. Created, is that which is in him as man, and is of three ſorts, Beatifical, Infuſed, and Experimental.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Beatifical Knowledge, is called the <hi>Knowledge of Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> by it he doth not only ſee <hi>God face to face,</hi> (as all the reſt of the bleſſed do) but ſeeth alſo the <hi>Manhood in Perſonal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with the Godhead.</hi> Chriſt hanging upon the Croſs had the Viſion of God, even then whiles he ſuffered deſertion by God: there was then perſonal union without any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of communion: The knowledge of the bleſſed, and the torment of the curſed: Of it, <hi>John</hi> 1.18. its principle: the perfect underſtanding of the Manhood: its <hi>Medium,</hi> the light of glory.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Infuſed, whereby he knoweth all things that can be known by the concreated abilities of Angels, or men, of it, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 11.2. Its Principle, is a habit infuſed of God; its <hi>Medium,</hi> the light of grace.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Experimental, whereby he knew all things that could be known by practiſe, and rational obſervation of Events, of it, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.52. Its Principle, the faculty of Reaſon: its <hi>Medium,</hi> perſonal experience, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.6. And obſervation of reiterated Events by the light of reaſon. Chriſt's beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial knowledge, neither admits increaſe, in reſpect of the habit, or act. His infuſed knowledge admitted not increaſe in reſpect of Habit, though it might in reſpect of the Act. His experimental knowledge ſeemeth to have admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, both in reſpect of the Habit, and Act. Chriſt's growth in wiſdom, is compared to his growth in ſtature, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.40.52.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Right of Divine Adoration, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Revel.</hi> 5.8. Yet we are to know, that we worſhip not with divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:118295:34"/>the Manhood as conſidered in it ſelf, but as being perſonally united to the Godhead: that is, <hi>We worſhip the Lord Jeſus as God-man.</hi>

               <p>The Compoſition which is of the divine, and humane Nature, is rather a Compoſition of Number, then of Parts; becauſe notwithſtanding the real change in the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thereby, it is without any change of the divine Nature, adding only a relation thereunto.

                  </note> but none in him: the divine Nature remaining what it was, aſſumed that which it was not.</p>
               <p>The divine and humane Nature, are as it were, Parts of the whole Perſon, (for the divine Nature is not a part pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly that would argue imperfection:) Now that which is true of a part abſolutely, is true of the whole in a limited ſence; <hi>i. e.</hi> in reſpect of thar part. Thus, that which is true of the ſoul or body, muſt needs be granted to be true of the whole man. So we ſay, ſuch a man ſtudieth, when it is his ſoul, not his body that ſtudieth; ſuch a man eateth, when it is his body, not his ſoul that eateth.</p>
               <p>The Communication of <hi>Idiomes,</hi> or Properties, taketh place when Chriſt is ſpoken of in the Concrete, not in the Abſtract: that is, when not one Nature only is intended, but the Perſon with both, or either Nature. For example ſake, <hi>The Lord of Glory is crucified,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.8. though it was only the humane, not the divine Nature that was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified. <hi>God purchaſed the Church with his own blood, Acts</hi> 20.28. Here God is taken in a concrete ſence, ſignifying the Perſon, together with the divine and humane Nature. <hi>The Man Chriſt Jeſus, is Mediatour,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. <hi>The Son of man hath power to forgive ſin, Matth.</hi> 9.6. <hi>This Man is God, &amp;c.</hi> The word <hi>Man</hi> is taken in a concrete ſence, ſignifying the perſon with the humane nature. Theſe ſpreches then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in the Concrete, the Communication of Properties
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:118295:34"/>is to be attended: both which conſiderations are of great uſe to help us to underſtand theſe, and the like Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Capableneſs of the Office of a Mediatour.</p>
               <p>The State wherein the Lord Jeſus executed his Office of Mediatourſhip; is either of Humiliation, or Exaltation.<note place="margin">Of the two States where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Chriſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and ſtill perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Office of a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour.</note>

               <p>The State of Humiliation, continued from the time of his Incarnation, until the time of his Reſurrection.</p>
               <p>The State of Exaltation began at his Reſurrection, and continueth for ever. The Degrees of his Exaltation were; His Reſurrection oppoſite to his Death: His Aſcenſion into Heaven, oppoſite to his Deſcent into the Grave: His ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at the right hand of the Majeſty of God, (that is, in a State of Glory, next to the Glory of God himſelf) oppoſite to his continuing in the grave.</p>
               <p>The Lord Jeſus Chriſt as God-man, now ſitting at the right hand of God, is ſtill fulfilling his Mediatourly Office; not in a condition of humiliation, as ſometimes upon earth; but in a manner ſutable unto his preſent State of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>

               <p>It is God Decreeing by one Act; whatſoever God will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, he willeth by one ſingle act, hence God calleth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>I Am, Exod.</hi> 3.14. to ſhew that he is without begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, without end, and without ſucceſſion. In him there is nothing paſt, nothing to come, but all is preſent. Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he thinks, he always hath thought, and always doth and will think. Whatſoever he willeth, he always hath Willed, and always doth, and will Will. There can be no more a new thought, a new intent, or a new purpoſe in God, then there can be a new God. This is further evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced from the Simplicity of God: which is God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as one, meer and perfect Act, without all compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition: Whence, he might either not have been, or may not be. Of him it never could, or can be ſaid; that any thing was to be in him, which is not, or cannot be, that is. A pure Act includes all perfection, and removeth all imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
               <p>It is an Eternal Act; without beginning, without end without all alteration, or ſucceſſion. God comprehendeth all things, and all events, together, and at once; in the moment of Eternity. Eternity is an everlaſting <hi>NOW:</hi> without beginning, without end, without ſucceſſion; all at once, always.</p>
               <p>It is a free act; proceeding from God, not as the Son from the Father, nor as the Holy Ghoſt, from the Father and the Son; by a neceſſity of nature: but ſo, as there is no neceſſary connexion between his abſolut being, and the being of the things that are Decreed. God hath no need of the things decreed, he might have been without them, he had been bleſſed for ever, though they had never been.</p>
               <p>It is a conſtant act; What God willeth, he willeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways:
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:118295:36"/>a meer, and a pure act, without any interruption, or ſhadow of change.</p>
               <p>By it, God determineth abſolutely; becauſe his Decree is the firſt and and univerſal cauſe, it is one Act, certain and independent: all things and all events depending there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</p>
               <p>By it, He determineth infallibly; God being immutable, infinitly wiſe, and able to ſee all his will fulfilled.</p>

               <p>The Sufficiency of God, in which the poſſibility of the creature is founded, precedeth the Decree in order of our conception.

               <p>Now all theſe predications joyntly are found, and only found in the poſſibility of the creature founded in the Suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of God: Therefore the creature in its condition of poſſibility, is the Object of the Decree.</p>
               <p>This Propoſition, aſſerting the creature in its condition of poſſibility, to be the Object of the Decree; agreeth every way with the Doctrine of the Nature of God, and inferreth no incongruities: whereas the aſſerting of any other object diſagreeth with the Nature of God, and inferreth intolerable inconſequences.</p>
               <p>From theſe grounds it is not hard to conceive, that not man conſidered as actually being; whether in his pure, or corrupt eſtate; but as yet to be, and in the Divine Eſſence: namely, as capable in reſpect of the Sufficiency of God, to be what he pleaſed, is the Object of the Decree: <hi>ſcil.</hi> as concerning man.</p>

               <p>For ſatisfaction of the Objection we muſt diſtinguiſh of Neceſsity.

The day goeth before the following night, and the night foregoeth the following day; yet night and day are far from being cauſes one of another.

                  </note> That the ſame act in a diverſe ſence, is both Evitable and inevitable. 3. That neceſsity and liberty conſi ſtrogether.</p>
               <p>The liberty of the ſecond cauſe, doth not conſiſt in a power of indifferency, to act or not to act: independent of, and not ſubordinate unto the Decree.</p>
               <p>The ſecond cauſe, however it acts, is ſubordinate to the firſt cauſe, for notwithſtanding the will is a free agent, yet it is a ſecond cauſe; therefore muſt needs be an effect, in reſpect of the firſt cauſe: and conſequently ſubordinate thereunto. The will of man is a free agent, but ſo, as it is a ſecond free agent; not a firſt free agent. The will is a free principle, but yet, it is a ſecond, not a firſt principle. The will is its own free mover, yet not its firſt mover. 'Tis true, the will is the cauſe of its own acting, yet ſo, as it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo true that it is not the firſt, but the ſecond cauſe of its acting.</p>
               <p>It is ſufficient unto the being of humane liberty,<note place="margin">In creaturis eſt <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>So far is the Decree which is an immanent act, or the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the ſecond cauſe in its working by the firſt, which is a tranſient act, from being a prejudice unto liberty, that the ſecond cauſe can neither be free, nor act freely, without both.</p>
               <p>It is truth, that the ſubordinate free-agent (the thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yet to do) may either do, or not do the ſame act: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, which of the two he will freely incline unto, is infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly fore-decreed. For example. <hi>Thomas</hi> not yet being

'Tis not a truth, That he can both actually come, and not into the houſe. 3. Tis a truth, he will do that of theſe two freely, which God hath decreed abſolutely.</p>
               <p>The ſame action in a divers ſence, is both evitable,<note place="margin">Partic. <hi>2.</hi>

                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 6. The Doctrine of the abſoluteneſs, and infallible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Decree, diſcourageth from the uſe of means.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> So the <hi>Maſſilienſes</hi> objected againſt <hi>Auguſtine;</hi> Superfluous (ſaid they) is labour in both parts, if he that is reprobated can by no induſtry be ſaved, nor he that is elected by no negligence fall ſhort of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>This Objection labours of that, which <hi>Logicians</hi> call the Fallacy of Diviſion, whereby in our arguing, thoſe things are divided which ought to be conjoyned: So here, the end, and the means to the end, are divided, which God in his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Counſel hath conjoyned.</p>
               <p>More particularly, The falſhood of this perillous, and juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abominable inference, appeareth thus.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is againſt Scripture, which holds forth the certaine truth of the connexion of the Antecedent and Conſequent, when yet both the Antecedent and Conſequent taken apart are falſe. That is, it holds forth a truth in the connexion of both the parts of ſuch a Propoſition; in either of whoſe parts, conſidered in themſelves, there is no truth. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, <hi>Acts</hi> 27.30. <hi>Except theſe abide in the Ship, ye cannot be ſaved.</hi> Here is a truth in the Connexion of both parts of the Propoſition: <hi>viz.</hi> The Antecedent, <hi>Except theſe abide in the ſhip:</hi> and the Conſequent, <hi>Ye cannot be ſaved.</hi> Yet could it not be a truth, either that the ſhip-men ſhould not abide in the ſhip, or that any man in the ſhip ſhould not be ſaved: God having before determined, that there ſhould be no loſs of any mans life amongſt them, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. and that
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:118295:50"/>by means of the ſhip-mens abiding in the ſhip: as appeareth out of the Text, <hi>ver.</hi> 27.31. and by the event. So in that Propoſition; <hi>If ye</hi> (Believers) <hi>live after the fleſh, ye ſhall dye, Rom.</hi> 8.13. Here is a truth in the Connexion of the parts, <hi>i. e.</hi> of the Antecedent and Conſequent of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition: <hi>viz. That if theſe believing Romans live finally after the fleſh, they ſhall dye, elſe the Scripture is not true:</hi> yet is there no truth in either of the parts thereof, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by themſelves. Not in the Antecedent, <hi>viz. Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers live finally afer the fleſh:</hi> Not in the Conſequent, <hi>viz. That Believers ſhall dye.</hi> The like is to be ſeen in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; <hi>If Judas believe, he ſhall be ſaved, If John believe not, he ſhall be damned.</hi> There is a truth in the Connexion of the Antecedent, and Conſequent of both: though the Antecedent and Conſequent of both, conſidered by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, are falſe. For though it be true, <hi>If Judas believe he ſhall be ſaved, and if John believe not he ſhall be damned:</hi> yet is it not true, either that <hi>Judas</hi> ſhall believe, or that <hi>Judas</hi> ſhall be ſaved; or that <hi>John</hi> ſhall not believe, or that <hi>John</hi> ſhall be damned. God then having decreed the end by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of the end and means together: 'Tis not a truth for us to conclude we ſhall attain the end, though we diſ-joyn the end, and means aſunder. It is therefore againſt the truth of the Scripture for an elect man to ſay, <hi>Though he live after the fleſh, he ſhall be ſaved:</hi> as alſo for the Reprobate to ſay, <hi>Though he live after the ſpirit, he ſhall be damned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It implyeth a contradiction, for us to acknowledge the Doctrine of the Decree, that tyeth the end and the means together to be a truth; and yet to ſay, it is in vain to uſe the means; for (that notwithſtanding) we ſhall not be partakers of the end.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is irrational, and it is as if one ſhould argue thus: Becauſe God hath decreed ſuch an end to be attained by ſuch means, therefore it is in vain to uſe the means to that end.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is at leaſt implicitely legal, in that it objects not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Decree ſimply, but alſo againſt our dependance upon the Efficiency of that Decree. It implying thus much,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:118295:51"/>we will uſe the means, if the uſe of means be in our power; but we have no heart to uſe the means, ſince both ſtrength to uſe it, and the ſucceſs of the uſe of it, proceed reſpectively from an abſolute predermination of God.<note place="margin">Si non vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis obedientia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ad quam nos licendilis in corde noſtro frigeſcere, nolite nobis iſtam Dei gratiam praedicare, quâ Deum dare fatemini, quae ut nos faciamus fortamini. <hi>Auguſt.</hi> de deno Perſerver. l. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>19.</hi>

               <p>To conclude ſo far is the doctrine of the Decree from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a prejudice to the uſe of means, as that the uſe of the means is part of it, the effect of it, and the knowledge thereof an obliging motive unto all that know it, an effectual motive unto all that are godly.<note place="margin">Obj. <hi>7.</hi>

               <p>Death (as we ſaw before) is conſidered as the deſtruction of the ſinner, or as an execution and declaration of Juſtice: God delights in it, as it is a declaration and execution of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; but not as it is the deſtruction of the ſinner. In the execution of Juſtice upon a Malefactor, we muſt diſtinguiſh between puniſhment and deſtruction: Puniſhment is from the Judg, deſtruction is from the evil doer. Puniſhment pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the Author of the Rule of Juſtice, as the efficient Cauſe; but deſtruction from ſin, as the meritorious Cauſe. Though puniſhment, as it deſtroyeth the creature, be an evil to Nature; yet, as it is a declaration of Juſtice, it is a moral good. 'Tis true, Condemnation followeth infallibly upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation: yet ſo, as Reprobation is the antecedent, not the cauſe of ſin; ſin both an antecedent and cauſe of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.

It was Gods abſolute Decree, to manifeſt the glory of his Juſtice in the puniſhment of man for his ſin againſt God in the Covenant of Works, as the event proveth: Yet this death abſolutely decreed was conditionally diſpenſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. <hi>In the day that thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt dye.</hi>

               <p>In this Decree Faith and Salvation are ſo indiviſibly joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, that whereſoever the one is,<note place="margin">Si credideris ſalvus eris. Reſp. ad Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinch. cap. <hi>5.</hi>
                  </note> there the other neceſſarily and infallibly followeth.

               </p>
               <p>Here behold the Wiſdom of God in the myſterious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of the Goſpel, whoſo adminiſters his abſolute De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree; as that there is as much place left for an efficacious conditional diſpenſation, as if the Decree it ſelf were condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional.</p>
               <p>Before the Elect do beleeve it is certain that they ſhall be ſaved, albeit they neither are in the ſtate of Salvation, nor know any more concerning the ſame according to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary diſpenſation of God, then one may do who is not elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. After that they do beleeve, and God perſonally hath revealed that they ſhall be ſaved, yet in caſe of backſliding from God, they may not only loſe the ſenſe of their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but alſo be juſtly delivered up to ſuch fears of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as if they were not in a ſafe eſtate.</p>
               <p>As it is a truth, that <hi>Peter</hi> a Beleever cannot ſin finally, but ſhall repent, and be ſaved: So it is a truth, that if <hi>Peter</hi> and the other Diſciples (though Beleevers) convert not from their preſent ambitious affectation of greatneſs, that they ſhall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.3. 'Tis a confeſſed truth, that the beleeving <hi>Romans</hi> cannot finally live after the fleſh, nor dye: and it is a truth alſo, that <hi>if ye, i. e.</hi> thoſe very beleeving Romans, <hi>live after the fleſh, they ſhall dye, Rom.</hi> 8.13.</p>

Counſel is attributed unto God, to ſhew, that whatſoever he doth, is done in perfect Judgment. All, even the leaſt of the motions of the creature, are ordered not by a counſel of men, or a counſel of Angels, but by the Counſel of God. The rings of the wheels (which ſignifie the changes of this life) though they were high and dreadful, yet were full of eyes, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.18. The Counſel of God runneth throughout his Providence. The Counſel of God is to be ſeen in the folly of man. The diſorder of the ſecond Cauſes, falleth under the order of the firſt. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree diſpoſeth both of the Means and the End; the Execution thereof conſiſting in Creation and Providence, is the only and beſt way to the beſt End.</p>
               <p>It is an Attribute of the firſt Being, that is, of God the Creator, to be the laſt End, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.4. <hi>Revel.</hi> 4.11. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 41.4. and 44.6. and 48.12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.36. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.8, 11, 17. and 21.6. and 22.13. This appears in that God hath all perfection. The final Cauſe therefore being a matter of perfection, God muſt needs be the final and univerſal End of all things. The ſame is concluded from the imperfection of the creature, the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:118295:59"/>end perfects the thing; if the creature were its own end, Gods work ſhould end in imperfection. As it is impoſſible that there ſhould be any creature that doth not depend upon the influence of God in its next efficient Cauſe; ſo, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible there ſhould be any creature, not depending upon the intention of the glory of God, ſo as to be referred there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto as unto its laſt End; otherwiſe there would be a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſus in infinit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But that ſpecial love of God unto his Elect (who together with the reſidue of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind lay equal in the guilt and pollution of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, and of original corruption) which made ſuch a difference between us, according to his gracious Decree in Jeſus Chriſt, as that leaving our fellow ſinners unto miſery from all Eternity he appointed his Son to deſcend down as low as Hell to fetch us from thence, and to aſcend up as high as Heaven to carry us up thither, for his alone merit, unto an eſtate more happy then that was miſerable which we had deſerved, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all our oppoſition thereunto. This, this is the great and glorious Cauſe of thankſgiving, holding forth a worthy
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:118295:61"/>demonſtration of ſuch Love, as became a God to ſhew to ſuch whom he was freely pleaſed to make his Favorites: a greater good then which God hath not willed to man; a greater debt then for the good of which man doth not owe to God. The ſight of Gods heart in his Decree, thus abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, everlaſtingly, effectually, and peculiarly (for Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion makes Election more admirable) affected to his Elect, is a means to conſtrain, inflame, raviſh and unite the hearts of the Elect univerſally and everlaſtingly unto God. It is an effect of Election, to be affected with the Decree of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>As the Elect have their being by grace, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. ſo their duty and ſpirit is, to be unto the praiſe of his glorious grace, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.6. As God openeth himſelf in no Truth more then this: ſo, they that love to ſee the ſhining face of God in Jeſus Chriſt, delight in no Truth more then this.</p>
               <p>This life is too ſhort, and ſpirits that dwell in fleſh too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, to expreſs their thankfulneſs for the Love of God, that unboſometh it ſelf unto his Elect in the doctrine of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree.

               <p>The Neceſſity of the concurrence of the firſt cauſe with the ſecond in the operations thereof, appears thus.</p>
               <p>All creatures depend upon God in reſpect of their Being, Conſervation, and Operation: <hi>For in him we live, and move, and have our being, Acts</hi> 17.28. <hi>We have our being,</hi> there is our dependance in reſpect of our Creation; <hi>we live,</hi> there is our dependance in reſpect of our Conſervation; <hi>we move,</hi> there is our dependance in reſpect of our Operation. Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:118295:64"/>depend no leſs upon God in reſpect of operations, then in reſpect of their beings; becauſe the operations of things in both inſtants, <hi>viz.</hi> both of being and of operation, are equally beings of participation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From the perfection of the firſt Cauſe; ſuch is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the firſt Cauſe being God, and the nature of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cauſe being a creature, as that thence neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth the amplitude of Perfection in the firſt Cauſe, and a univerſal and ſubordinate dependance in the ſecond cauſe in reſpect of its efficiency. In this regard <hi>Plato</hi> called the ſecond cauſes the inſtruments of the firſt Cauſe; which though in ſome reſpect it holdeth not,<note place="margin">Rhetorf. Ex. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>2.</hi> de effi. grat.</note> becauſe inſtruments (properly ſo called) have no proper efficiency; yet ſo far it is a truth, as that every creature univerſally dependeth more upon God, then any creature upon its fellow-creature.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It implyeth a contradiction,<note place="margin">Omnia pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent a Deo eſſentialiter immediatè intrinſicè, abſolutè, aeque ac ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitèr.</note> that the creature ſhould be able to act without dependancy upon the Creator. 1. Becauſe the agent being a creature is depending, therefore its power to act is depending; the power of acting holds proportion with the agent. 2. Becauſe the action proceeding from this agent, is a being by participation: it is impoſſible for the creature to have other then a depending being.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As the conſerving influence of God is unto the conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the creature, ſo is the aſſiſting influence of God unto the operation of the creature: If God doth but meerly ceaſe his conſerving influence, the creature ceaſeth to be; if God ceaſeth his aſſiſting influence, the creature ceaſeth to act. The inſenſible ceſſation of the influence of the firſt Cauſe, without any further violence, or hurt done, puts a period to the being, or ſtoppeth the operation of the ſecond cauſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively.</p>

Foregoeth the operation of the ſecond cauſe in order, though it be together with it in time.</p>
               <p>The concurring influence of the Creator, is the action of the firſt Cauſe; the operation of the creature following thereupon, is the action of the ſecond cauſe, and an effect of that concurring influence. Now ſuch an operation of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:118295:65"/>cauſe muſt needs follow the concurrence of the firſt; becauſe of the order of Cauſes, the firſt is before the ſecond: Of the dignity of the firſt Cauſe, the firſt is more worthy then the ſecond: Of the dependance of the ſecond cauſe, the ſecond cauſe depends on the firſt: Of the eſſential ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the ſecond Cauſe, that which is eſſentially, <hi>i. e.</hi> by abſolute neceſſity of Nature, ſubordained, is conſequent to that whereto it is ſubordained: And laſtly, it is manifeſt in the operation of the creature as an effect thereof; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring influence of the Creator is the firſt Cauſe, the effect is after the cauſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>2.</hi> Co-work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> It is by way of Co-operation, or co-working with the ſecond cauſe in this co-operation: Concurſe (as was now intimated) is the action of the firſt Cauſe; the operation is the action of the ſecond cauſe; from both conjoyned pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth the effect. Though the effect wrought by means of the operation of the ſecond cauſe, and the operation by means whereof the effect is wrought, are both the effects of the firſt Cauſe: yet in the producing of ſuch effects, as are wrought by means of the creature; as the ſecond cauſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not produce ſuch an effect without the firſt Cauſe, ſo the firſt Cauſe will not produce ſuch effects-without the ſecond cauſe; the conjunction of the operation of the firſt Cauſe with the ſecond, in bringing forth ſuch effects, is the co-operation here ſpoken of.</p>
               <p>In this Co-operation of the firſt Cauſe with the ſecond, neceſſary it is that the co-operation of the ſecond cauſe with the firſt (which neceſſarily followeth thereupon) is abſolutely ſubordinate, not co-ordinate with the firſt Cauſe.</p>
               <p>A co-ordinate Cauſe worketh of it ſelf, not depending up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on its co-working cauſe, or cauſes. A ſubordinate cauſe is that which dependeth upon its ſuperior Cauſe in reſpect of its working, as the Officer upon the Magiſtrate.</p>
               <p>An abſolute ſubordinate Cauſe, is that which dependeth abſolutely upon its ſuperior Cauſe, in reſpect of its working: ſo all ſecond cauſes depend upon the firſt Cauſe.</p>
               <p>The concurrence of the firſt Cauſe with the ſecond,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>3.</hi> Immediate</note> is immediate, both in reſpect of the immediation of its virtue,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:118295:65"/>and the immediation of his preſence.</p>
               <p>When we ſay the firſt Cauſe concurreth immediately with the ſecond, the meaning is, that in the co-operation thereof, it ſo works with and upon the ſecond cauſe, as it intimately reacheth it; and ſo, as nothing is interpoſed: as it is with two things that touch one another, between which there is nothing.</p>
               <p>Immediateneſs of preſence is, when things ſo act one upon another, as that the beings, or ſubſtances of the things, are preſent with one another, and touch one the other: So fire burning the ſtubble doth immediately touch it, not only with the immediation of its virtue, but alſo with the immediation of its preſent ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>Immediateneſs of virtue, is, when notwithſtanding the things that act one upon another, touch not one another in reſpect of their beings; yet the virtue of the one reacheth, and as it were toucheth the other, (otherwiſe there could be no working of one thing upon another, all acting being by contact, <hi>i. e.</hi> mutual touching either really and virtually, or virtually, though not really:) So, the fire that warmeth, though it reacheth not him that ſitteth by it with its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance (for then it would burn him,<note place="margin">Deus agit indiſtanter.

                  </note>) yet it reacheth him with its virtue, otherwiſe it could not warm him.</p>
               <p>Now, though it be many times a truth concerning the working of ſecond cauſes one upon another, that they work immediately in reſpect of their virtue, but not in reſpect of the preſence of their beings themſelves; as appeared but now from the inſtance of fire, and may further be ſeen in the example of the Sun, which whileſt experience witneſſeth to warm and heat us upon Earth with the preſence of its virtue, yet Senſe and Reaſon ſhews to be far abſent in reſpect of its body, being in the Heavens: Yet ſuch is the nature of the firſt Cauſe, as that whereſoever it worketh it worketh imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, both with the immediation of his virtue, without which there could be no effect; and with the immediation of his preſence, becauſe he is in every place.</p>
               <p>Although the firſt Cauſe worketh immediately in reſpect of the immediation of its being and virtue; yet in reſpect of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:118295:66"/>thoſe things, which it acts by means of ſecond cauſes, whether by the mediation of the beings themſelves,<note place="margin">Ames Med. lib. <hi>1.</hi> cap. <hi>9.</hi>
                  </note> or of their virtues, into which things the ſecond agents do ſend their influence by virtue of their proper forms; I ſay, in reſpect of ſuch things it worketh mediately: whence the firſt Cauſe is ſaid to be a mediate cauſe in reſpect of the order of the ſecond cauſes.<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>na eſtactio I ei &amp; crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae reſpectu operis, ſed non reſpectu mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di agendi. <hi>4.</hi> Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</note> For though (as the beings, ſo) the operations of the ſecond cauſes, are from the firſt Cauſe efficiently; yet they are from their next cauſes formally. God cauſeth the burning of the fire, yet we do not ſay God burneth, but the fire burneth. God worketh repentance in the Soul, yet it is not a truth to ſay God repenteth, but man repenteth; God is the next efficient Cauſe, but not the next formal Cauſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The firſt Cauſe ſo concurreth, as it determineth the ſecond cauſe in its operation. This is readily granted in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural agents, in free-rational agents it is proved thus. If the futurition of the operation of the ſecond cauſe is determined by the Decree of God, then the operation it ſelf is determined by the Efficiency of God. 1. Becauſe the Efficiency is ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to the Decree. 2. Becauſe there can be but one ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Determiner. 3. If the operation of the ſecond cauſe were not abſolutely determined by the Decree, God might ſuffer diſappointment in reſpect of the Decree.</p>
               <p>Either the Will is determined by God in its operation, or elſe it would follow, either that there were not an eſſential ſubordination of the ſecond cauſe unto the firſt, that is, of man to God, which were repugnant to the nature of the ſecond cauſe (it being imperfect and dependent;) or that the firſt Cauſe were ſubordinate to the ſecond, which were repugnant to the nature of the firſt Cauſe, being perfect and univerſal.</p>
               <p>If as often as the Will doth not will, it therefore doth not will, becauſe God hath not determined that it ſhould will: then as often as it willeth any thing, it therefore willeth, becauſe God hath determined that it ſhould will. But as oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en as the Will doth not will, it therefore doth not will, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath not determined that it ſhould will.

Take away action from the ſecond cauſe, and you take away the vegetative ſoul, and its operations from living creatures. You take away the ſenſitive ſoul, and its operations from the ſenſitive creature. The reaſonable ſoul, and its operations from the reaſonable creature. There is no difference to be found between reaſonable creatures, and ſenſible creatures: between reaſonable, ſenſible, and thoſe creatures which are vegetative, only having life: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween reaſonable, ſenſible, and vegetative, and thoſe that are lifeleſs, in reſpect of their formal, and moſt noble differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which is a principle of action, with the operations thereupon enſuing. There remains indeed a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, in reſpect of their outward ſhape, but not in regard of the reſpect fore-mentioned.</p>
               <p>It takes away the diſtinction between good and evil acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for that which denyeth actions ſimply, denyeth all kind of actions whether good or evil; therefore, man in all his ways dothneither good, nor evil: He doth no good, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no Heaven, becauſe of a double incapacity.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In reſpect of Nature; he that neither underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, willeth, remembreth, or is affected (all thoſe are acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) is uncapable of bleſſedneſs: bleſſedneſs conſiſting in the viſion, and fruition of the chief good.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In reſpect of the way to Heaven; namely, obedience, which man not being a ſubject of action, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of: without action there cannot be obedience; and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:118295:67"/>as he doth no good, ſo neither doth he any evil, therefore ſinneth not: therefore, there ought to be no conſcience of ſin, nor puniſhment for ſin. The Sum is, from hence it followeth, <hi>That man may do what he liſts, he neither ſinneth, nor obeyeth:</hi> There is neither Heaven nor Hell, without the actions of man, there could be no obedience of man; if there could not be the obedience of man, there could not be the obedience of Chriſt, who is God-man: if there could be no obedience of Chriſt, Chriſt could be no Saviour: nay, if there were no actions of man, (the very reaſonable ſoul by juſt conſequence ſuppoſing action) it would infer, that there were no man, and conſequently no Chriſt, Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both God and man.</p>
               <p>See then, and be aſtoniſhed at that heap of tranſgreſſion and confuſion in this opinion, that denyeth the Efficiency of the ſecond cauſe: It is againſt all experience, againſt the whole order of the creature; it takes away the vegetative, ſenſible, and rational ſouls, with all other operations; it takes away all difference between creatures in thoſe reſpects: it alloweth man and devils to do what they will: it denyeth that there is either obedience, or ſin; Heaven or hell:<note place="margin">Sic ita<expan>

               <p>The reaſon why works wrought by God efficiently, are yet aſcribed unto man; are, firſt, becauſe man (God not for want of power, but out of abundance of goodneſs being ſo far pleaſed to make uſe of him) co-worketh with God therein.

Man, even in violating Gods Command, fulfilleth Gods Decree. The Order of the Command, is
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:118295:69"/>either the Law of Nature, the Rule of the unreaſonable creature: whoſe Government according thereunto, ſee in this <hi>Chapter</hi> a little after the beginning. Or the Moral Law, the Rule of the reaſonable creature: whoſe ſubjection there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, is the greateſt difficulty: Touching which, together with what the Reader may be pleaſed to recall, of that which hath been ſpoken to this purpoſe, immediately after the place fore-mentioned; it may ſuffice, at preſent to anſwer this Objection (which Anſwer is yet eaſily and readily upon occaſion applicable unto the Angels,) ſo far only as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth the Government of ungoverned man.</p>
               <p>The containing of man in ſubjection to the Rule, is Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
               <p>The ſubjection of man to the Rule, is either obediential, <hi>i. e.</hi> active-obediential; or obligatory and penal: Obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial (in this ſence) conſiſts in our yeilding obedience unto the Command: Obligatory, conſiſts either in our bonds of duty, or guilt, whereby we ſtand bound over unto puniſhment in caſe of breach. Penal conſiſts in our ſuffering of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment denounced in the Curſe, for our diſobedience unto the Command.</p>
               <p>As the obediential ſubjection of the Saints, ſatisfactory in their ſurety, and gratulatory in their own perſons (together with their caſtigative and obligatory obedience, reſpectively) demonſtrates Gods government of his Saints, on the one hand: ſo doth the obligatory and penal ſubjection of the Reprobate, demonſtrate Gods government of the wicked on the other hand; and of both, according to his Word.</p>
               <p>Gods containing of the Saints in an obediential ſubjection to the Law, ſheweth his Government of them: Gods con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the wicked in obligatory and penal ſubjection to the Law, ſo as he reſerveth them all in the bond of duty, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of guilt, unto the time of Judgment, then to ſuffer the puniſhment held forth in the Curſe, proportionable to their diſobedience unto the Rule, ſheweth his Government of them: Both ſhew his Government of all.

               <p>The principal Objections againſt the divine Government
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:118295:69"/>of all things, taken from the pretended diſorder of the ſecond Cauſes, are either ſuch as ſtrike at the Wiſdom, or ſuch as ſtrike at the Juſtice of the Governor.</p>
               <p>Touching that Objection taken from the ſeeming diſorder of the ſecond cauſes, as ſtriking at the Wiſdom of God.</p>
               <p>We are to know, that Wiſdom is the diſcerning the right way unto the beſt End. Now that the way of God (conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Creation and Providence) is the beſt way to the beſt End, is clear, firſt, From the natural Juſtice of God; whereby, giving unto himſelf that which is his, it is neceſſary that he doth all his work as becometh ſuch an Agent; that is, by ſuch means, and in ſuch order, as is moſt ſuitable unto their End. Secondly, From the end of all things, and all events: The end of all things is either ſubordinate, <hi>viz.</hi> the good of the creature, looked at in it ſelf. Or ſupream, <hi>viz.</hi> the manifeſtation of the glory of the Creatour.</p>
               <p>God ordereth things in ſuch a way, as though it ſerveth not moſt to the good of the creature conſidered in it ſelf, (though it be alſo a truth concerning the Elect, that their happineſs is included therein:) yet ſuch as ſerveth moſt unto their chief good, and laſt end: namely, the Manifeſtation of his own Glory.</p>
               <p>We muſt diſtinguiſh between the Order of the Decree, and the Order of the Command: Diſorder in reſpect of the Command, is Order in reſpect of the Decree: Thus both order and diſorder in reſpect of the Command, are order in reſpect of the Decree. The Wiſdom of the firſt cauſe ſhineth in the folly of the ſecond cauſe. The Order of the Creatour diſpoſeth of, and runneth through the confuſion of the creature. The face of Providence is oftentimes like unto ſome picture, which if you look upon it on the one ſide caſteth a deformed ſhape: but if you behold it on the other ſide, it preſenteth you with a moſt grateful aſpect. Faith ſeeth beauty, where reaſon ſeeth only confuſion. What ſight more horrid then the ſufferings of Chriſt, if looked upon in the wiſdom of man? few more glorious, if beheld in the Wiſdom of God. <hi>He hath made every thing beautiful in its time, Eccleſ.</hi> 3.11.

The Permiſſion of ſin for a much better good, then ſin is an evil (of which in the Doctrine of the Decree, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.) is no way repugnant unto the Juſtice of God, held forth in the Law; whereby God hath not bound himſelf from the permiſſion of ſin.

Concerning the Adverſity of the godly: Here would be no place for ſo much ſin, as to queſtion Gods Juſtice; did we not forget, that his Saints in this life are ſinners; the beſt of them that ſuffer moſt, ſuffer leſs then they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve: <hi>Thou our God haſt puniſhed us, leſs then our iniquities deſerve, Ezra</hi> 9.13.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Though the ſins of the Saints deſerve why God may deny unto them temporal mercies; and why he may inflict upon them temporal croſſes; yet the ſins of the ungodly do not deſerve that God muſt deny unto them temporal mercies; or that he muſt inflict upon them ſuch temporal croſſes. The Juſtice of God in the Law, puniſhing the ſins of the Reprobate in their meaſure, and ſeaſon, for ever: reſtraineth not God from ſhewing common mercies unto them, according as he pleaſeth for a time. Adde hereunto, that their bleſſings are curſed.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That the various diſpenſation in ordering events, not falling out alike in point of affliction, with them who are alike in tranſgreſſion: is no way prejudicial to the Juſtice of God, may appear, 1. By conſidering the condition of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:118295:71"/>men in general. 2. By comparing the ſeveral conditions of men one with another. If you look upon the condions of men in general; then, as notwithſtanding ſuch are the ſins of the Saints, as that they deſerve, (which alſo God may do in a way of trial of his ſervants, or for teſtimony to his truth, or upon the point of his meer Soveraignty) why God might viſit them with continuing temporal chaſtiſement: yet ſuch is the grace of God in Chriſt, whence he may not only ſpare them, but alſo confer ſpecial favour upon them: ſo notwithſtanding the ſins of the wicked are ſuch, why God might; yet doth not Juſtice require that God muſt always afflict them with temporal ſorrows: or that he may not at times, ſhine upon them with temporal bleſſings.</p>
               <p>The ſame is further to be ſeen, by laying the ſeveral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of men one unto another.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. If we compare wicked men with wicked men, their puniſhments are corporal, or ſpiritual; theſe temporal, or eternal: If God puniſheth not in the one, he neither doth, or will puniſh in the other, firſt, or laſt; more, or leſs, here, or hereafter, ſo, as in concluſion, each impenitent one ſhall ſuffer according to their deſerts, none more, none leſs.</item>
                  <item>2. If we compare the Saints with the Saints; their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſements are various, both inward, and outward: that which they ſuffer not one way, who can ſay they ſuffer not another? The concluſion alſo with them all will prove all ſin to end in loſs and grief; and all obedience to end in end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs gain and joy. Their repentance ſhall hold proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with their offence, and glory ſhall be anſwerable unto grace.</item>
                  <item>3. If we compare the wicked with the godly, (always remembring that the ſins of the wicked are fully puniſhed in Hell: the ſins of the Elect already puniſhed in their Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and in due time chaſtiſed in their own perſons) we are further to conſider, that the great difference between the godly, and ungodly, is not in things viſible, or pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this life: but in their ſtate reſpectively after this life. The chaſtiſements of the Saints do not exceed, but are far
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:118295:72"/>ſhort of their deſerts: the puniſhment of the wicked ſhall be according to their deſerts. 'Tis not againſt juſtice, that the Saints ſuffer chaſtiſement, before the wicked ſuffer pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment: It is of mercy, that they ſo ſuffer chaſtiſement, as that they may not ſuffer puniſhment with the World, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.32.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Gods judicial acts of Providence are oftentimes ſuch in this life, whence he convinceth the beholders, that he govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth amongſt the moſt ungoverned of the ſons of men: ſo that a man ſhall ſay, <hi>Verily there is a reward for the righteous, verily he is a God that judgeth in the Earth, Pſal.</hi> 58.11.</p>
               <p>Not mans reaſon, but Gods Word, is the Interpreter of Gods Works: Whence, in the Pſalmiſts temptation, we might attain the Pſalmiſts ſatisfaction, did we ſeek it with the like ſpirit: <hi>When I ſought to know this, it was too painful for me, till I entered into the ſanctuary of the L rd, Pſal.</hi> 73.16, 17.</p>
               <p>If yet we cannot ſee that God governeth according to his Law, nor how his Word and Works of Providence do agree, the error is in our Judgment, not in his Government.</p>
               <p>We know that God is juſt in all his ways, though the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Juſtice of ſome of his ways, we know not. That Gods Word and his Works agree, is manifeſt unto us; though how they agree, is ſometimes hidden from us.</p>
               <p>The ſeeming defects of Beauty, or Juſtice, in the Works of God, proceed from the error of our underſtanding, not from any want in Providence: The offence that man takes at the Providence of God, is taken, not given.</p>
               <p>A preſervative againſt temptations, ariſing from difficulties concerning the Juſtice of the Government of God, is to cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Reaſon unto Faith; and to hold theſe three Concluſions firm, though we ſee not the reaſon of the premiſſes. 1. That God is righteous: <hi>Righteous art thou O Lord when I plead with thee, yet let me talk with thee of thy Judgments, Jer.</hi> 12.1. 2. That godlineſs doth us good, and no hurt: <hi>Truly God is good to Iſrael, even to ſuch as are of a clean heart, Pſal.</hi> 73.1. 3. That ſin doth us hurt, and no good: <hi>Though a ſinner doth evil an hundred times, and his days be prolonged; yet ſurely I know that it ſhall be with well them that fear God, which fear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:118295:72"/>him: But it ſhall not be well with the wicked, neither ſhall he prolong his days, which are as a ſhadow, becauſe he feareth not before God, Eccleſ.</hi> 8.12, 13.</p>

               <p>God's Decree is the Rule of his Efficiency: <hi>Who worketh all things according to the Counſel of his own will, Epheſ.</hi> 2.11.</p>
               <p>God's Efficiency is anſwerable unto his Decree.</p>
               <p>The univerſal Efficiency of the firſt cauſe, and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Efficiency of the ſecond cauſe, conſiſt together: <hi>Workout your own ſalvation with fear and trembling: For it is God which worketh in you, to will, and to do, of his good pleaſure, Philip.</hi> 2.12, 13.</p>
               <p>The ſecond cauſe acts, and doth its actions as properly, really, and formally: as if (upon a ſuppoſition, which yet is impoſſible) there were no firſt cauſe. The firſt cauſe acts, and doth all things as properly, and really, as if there were no ſecond cauſe.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the creature in regard of its formal free-efficiency, is ſomewhat diſtinguiſhed from a meer inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: yet, even thoſe effects wherein God uſeth the ſecond cauſe, as a ſubordinate free-agent, depend upon, and are determined by the firſt cauſe; as much as where the ſecond cauſe is a meer paſſive inſtrument; becauſe the free-effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of the ſecond cauſe, is the effect of the firſt cauſe. And as much as thoſe effects, for the producing of which, a man makes uſe of a meer inſtrument; depend upon, and are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the man, who uſed that inſtrument. Becauſe an inſtrument being a creature, cannot depend upon its fellow-creature, ſo much as every creature depends upon its Creatour. And hence it is, that ſecond free-agents are ſometimes compared unto meer inſtruments.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding ſin is wholly of man, and ſubordinate efficiency in ſinful actions, belongs formally unto the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cauſe: yet the infallible futurition, and execution of all effects: the infallible futurition, and ordering the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of all events; is as fully aſcribed unto God, as if man had no hand therein. <hi>So then it was not you that ſent me hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but God, Gen.</hi> 45.8.</p>

If <hi>Joſeph</hi> intend to be an object of fear unto his Brethren, he acts this part, whileſt they look at him as a Judg, before he revealeth himſelf to be a Brother. The time between the reſt of the Soul in ſin, and the grace of faith, is not only the fitteſt, but the only ſeaſon to affect the Soul with the ſpirit of bondage. The Soul cannot be affected with the ſpirit of fear whileſt it is at eaſe in ſin; to be in fear, and not to be in fear in the ſame reſpect, is a contradiction: Neither can the ſpirit of bondage be in a Beleever; <hi>Ye have not received the ſpirit of bondage to fear again, Rom.</hi> 8.15. This fear is the work of the Spirit of God, in the working whereof the Spirit doth two things. 1. It threatens the Soul with the Curſe, as juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly due to and impending over it in that eſtate. 2. It cauſeth the Soul to fear this wrath: Now the Spirit cannot cauſe this fear in a Beleever, to whom there is no condemnation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. for in ſo doing, he ſhould affirm, and cauſe the Soul to beleeve, and to be affected with an untruth, which vvere blaſphemy to think: beſides, the ſpirit of ſervile fear, and the ſpirit of Adoption, are oppoſite; either then there is no ſpirit of bondage, or it is betvveen the reſt of the Soul in ſin, and faith in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Preparatory works precede vocation in way of order, not in way of cauſality: God giveth Chriſt after them as the way, not for them, as the cauſe. Preparatory work, is the effect of free common grace: as ſaving work is the effect of free ſpecial grace. It can therefore be no more prejudice unto grace, then a free way is unto a free thing, whereunto it is the way. No more then freedom prejudiceth freedom: <hi>i. e.</hi> No more then a free act of an inferiour nature prejudiceth a free act of a ſuperiour na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. It doth no whit touch it in it ſelf, it in many reſpects cleareth it, but no way darkeneth it unto us.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is not ſaid ſo, therefore it was not ſo; is no good conſequence. 'Tis a frequent thing in the Scripture, to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the thing done, without mentioning the manner of the doing of that thing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.9. <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, yet is ſilent of the Order of creating, <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.2. We read that <hi>Abraham</hi> begat <hi>Iſaac,</hi> but of the manner of his begetting him, <hi>viz.

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:118295:81"/>wonders, and by an out-ſtretched arme, is wholly omitted. 'Tis in this caſe between the thing done, and the manner of the doing thereof, as between the Sacrament inſtituted, and the Order of the inſtitution: The Sacrament is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times mentioned, where the Order of the inſtitution is not obſerved, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. As therefore he that would inform himſelf of the Order of the Inſtitution, and Adminiſtration of the Elements in the Supper, is not to learn it from thoſe Texts, where (though the matter be recited, yet) the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Order is not held forth: ſo, he that would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct himſelf concerning Preparatory Work in order to converſion, is not to look unto thoſe places: where (though the work of converſion be recorded, yet) the teaching of Preparatory Work is not intended; but unto ſuch Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures where the Doctrine of Preparatory Work is purpoſely taught.</p>

               <p>If we underſtand it actually it ſeemeth to be but an actual ſeparation of him to the Office of a Prophet.</p>

               <p n="1">1. The Conviction of the Holineſs and Spiritualneſs of the Law, is that Work of the Spirit, whereby the Soul is enlightened to ſee the Conformity of the Command unto the Will of God: whether we underſtand by command the Precept concerning the not eating of the Tree of Life, or the Decalogue preſcribed unto man in innocency, as the rule of life, and manners; Therefore called the Moral Law, or any other Commandement of God; Ceremonial, Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, or whatſoever: This conviction is called the coming of the Commandement. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9. <hi>For I was alive with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Law once, but when the Commandement came, ſin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived, and I dyed:</hi> It cauſeth a Doctrinal Approbation thereof. <hi>The Law is h ly, and the Commandement holy, and juſt, and good.</hi> The Precept is holy, the Curſe is juſt, the Promiſe is good.

               <p n="2">2. Conviction of Sin, is the conſcience of our tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of this holy Law: Sin is conſidered in reſpect of its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the kinds of it, and the dominion of it. <hi>Sin is the tranſgreſſion of the Law,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.4.

               <p>Actual Sin, is the ſwerving of the act of man either in thought, word, or deed from the Law of God, either by Omiſſion, or Commiſſion.</p>
               <p>The Dominion of Sin, is that reigning power of concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence, whence we ſin freely, neceſſarily, continually; and together with its malignity, doth notably appear in the irritation of concupiſcence, by occaſion of the Doctrine of the Law: But ſin taking occaſion by the Commandement, wrought in me all manner of concupiſcence, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.8.

               <p n="3">3. This Good Pleaſure, or Will of God, is the Rule of Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>The Will of God, is God himſelf vvillng, his Will is the Rule of our vvills, Whoſe Will elſe ſhould be the Rule? The Will of God is the cauſe of all things, the conſtituted Rule of Righteouſneſs therefore being an effect, it muſt needs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the Will of God, othervviſe there ſhould be an effect vvhich vvere not reſolved to the firſt cauſe.</p>
               <p>That vvhich is the Fountain of all good, is the Rule of Righteouſneſs: but Gods Will is the Fountain of all good: All Laws vvhich have their beginning in time, as the Lavv of Nature, the Lavv of Nations, the Moral Lavv, all Civil Lavv, vvhether fundamental, or poſitive; that are confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the Moral Lavv (as all ought to be) flovv from the Will of God, vvhich is the Eternal Lavv: That vvhich is juſt in it ſelf, is the Rule of Juſtice to all other things, that are juſt. But the Will of God is juſt in it ſelf, becauſe the Will of God, is God himſelf vvilling. God is eſſentially juſt. Either Relative Juſtice is regulated by the Will of God, or the Will of God, as vvilling relative juſtice, is regulated by it: But the Will of God cannot be regulated by any Rule precedaneous unto it; becauſe it vvould thence follovv that he vvere not infinitely juſt.</p>
               <p>Hence the Demerit of ſin being according to the Order of Juſtice, (for the demerit of ſin intends nothing elſe, but
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:118295:85"/>that which is due thereto, according to the conſtituted rule of moral righteouſneſs between God and man) and the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of juſtice proceeding from the free good pleaſure of God: it followeth, that the demerit of ſin receiveth its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, meaſure, and limits from the Will of God: according as he hath revealed himſelf in the Moral Law; ſo that the damned in Hell ſuffer not more nor leſs then they deſerved; yea, had God pleaſed to have inflicted a greater puniſhment for ſin, it had been juſt: as alſo if he had pleaſed to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted a leſſer puniſhment for ſin, it had been juſt. The ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners demerit is ſuch, whereupon it is free for God to deny mercy, and juſt for him to puniſh ſin: but a ſinner (which hath been intimated formerly) hath not merited, that God ſhould ſhew no mercy; for then it would be unjuſt with God, to pardon ſin. 'Tis an unmoved, and received Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; God doth not will things, becauſe they are juſt; but things are therefore juſt, becauſe God ſo willeth them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. God proceeding to execute juſtice according to this rule of righteouſneſs doth no wrong, can do no wrong.<note place="margin">Summi boni offenſio merc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batur ſumma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> poenam h. e. creaturae ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternam de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructionem. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſin.

                  </note> God being an infinite Being, againſt whom ſin is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and the perſon ſuffering for ſin being but finite: The Object offended being God; the perſon ſuffering being but a man, the evil of puniſhment cannot exceed the evil of offence. Thus <hi>David</hi> willing to juſtifie God, mentions the object againſt whom he ſinned, as a reaſon whereupon to infer the juſtice of the puniſhment. <hi>Againſt thee, thee only have I ſinned, and done this evil in thy ſight: that thou mighteſt be juſtified when thou ſpeakeſt, and clear when thou judgeſt, Pſal.</hi> 51. 4. The offence of the chief good might well deſerve the greateſt puniſhment, that is, the eternal deſtruction of the creature. Chriſt the Surety ſuffering death for all his Elect (amongſt which are children guilty of no actual ſin) it was therefore juſt that thoſe children ſhould dye. Beſides, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hinders why thoſe words of <hi>David</hi> (perſonating Chriſt even in the very hotteſt of his paſſion upon the Croſs, as acknowledging God to be holy) <hi>O my God I cry in the day time, and thou heareſt not, but thou art holy:</hi> may not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the juſtice of the wrath of God, (The curſe
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:118295:86"/>being executed upon him who was made ſin for the Elect ſake,) and not reſtrained only unto the Juſtice of the Promiſe belonging to the Elect for Chriſts ſake.</p>
               <p>This appears further from the Office of God, <hi>viz.</hi> that he is Judg of the World: <hi>Is God unrighteous that taketh ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance?

Laſtly, From the Nature of God, who is eſſentially juſt, and his Will (as was ſaid before) is the Rule of Juſtice. To grant that God can will Injuſtice as ſuch, is to grant that God can be unjuſt, that is, to grant that God cannot be God.</p>
               <p>We cannot acknowledg the Juſtice of God, if we do not acknowledg ſin: The acknowledgment of the righteouſneſs of ſo great an evil of puniſhment as is contained in the Curſe, neceſſarily preſuppoſeth an anſwerable evil of offence in ſin.</p>
               <p>We cannot acknowledg Grace, if we do not acknowledg both ſin and Juſtice: Impunity, where puniſhment is not juſt, is but abſtaining from an act of Injuſtice, and no act of Grace: If Damnation were not juſt, the gift of Salvation (in ſome reſpect) were not Grace.</p>
               <p>The due acknowledgment of the Juſtice of God, makes the ſufferer more quiet and patient, God the more glorious, ſin more ſinful, ſinners more awful.</p>
               <p>Unjuſt therefore (in caſe of puniſhment for ſin) is mans complaint of God in point of Juſtice.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe God puniſheth no man but for ſin. God now having freely bound himſelf to ſuch an order of Juſtice, is relatively juſt neceſſarily: yet this relative Juſtice proceeds to execution by accident, that is, in caſe of ſin. Gods Decree and Juſtice notwithſtanding, if man had not ſinned, he ſhould not have dyed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, When God puniſheth for ſin, he delighteth not
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:118295:86"/>in the death of a ſinner, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.23, 32. and 33.11.</p>
               <p>Puniſhment here is to be conſidered as it is an execution of Juſtice, but not as it is the deſtruction of the creature: God delights in it as it is the execution of Juſtice, but not as it is the deſtruction of the creature.</p>
               <p>Puniſhment is to be looked at as a natural evil, or as a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral good: As it is the deſtruction of the creature, it is a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural evil, <hi>i. e.</hi> an evil to Nature: as it is the execution of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, it is a moral good. <hi>O Iſrael, thou haſt deſtroyed thy ſelf, but in me is thy help, Hoſea</hi> 13.9. The living man afflicted ſhould complain of his ſin, not of his ſuffering.</p>
               <p>But we are not hence to infer, that we ought to be content to be damned: To juſtifie God is our duty, but to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to be damned is no where commanded; nay if taken without limitation, it is prohibited; becauſe to be contented to be damned, is to be contented to be an Enemy, and to ſin againſt God, and that for ever; the condition of the damned including an everlaſting ſtate of enmity and ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 9.3. wiſheth himſelf, for his brethrens ſake, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed from the fruit of the love of Chriſt, not from the love of Chriſt: he vviſheth to be vvithout the viſion and fruition of Chriſt, not to be the Enemy of Chriſt: he vviſheth to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh not as an Enemy of Chriſt, but as a Saviour to his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: he vviſeth to them his Salvation, but he doth not vviſh unto himſelf their Damnation. The like is to be judged of <hi>Moſes</hi> requeſt, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.32.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Inexcuſeableneſs is that effect of the legal Work of the Spirit, vvhence the Soul lying under conviction of the nature of the Command, ſin, guilt, and the Juſtice of God againſt ſinners, notvvithſtanding any former ſhifts, cavils, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, or vvhatſoever elſe, againſt the mutableneſs of our Creraion, <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, original ſin, actual ſin, or the Juſtice of God, is vvholly left vvithout any excuſe of, or defence for it ſelf; ſo as novv God is juſtified in his ſaying, and overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vvhen he judgeth.</p>

               <p>Preparatory, or legal repentance, is a common work of the Spirit; wrought by the Miniſtery both of the Law, and Goſpel, ſuper-adding unto what was wrought by the meer Doctrine of the Law, a further diſcovery unto, and affecting of the ſoul with the ſenſe of its utter preſent-periſhing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition under, and fear of the future aggravated puniſhment for ſin: whereby the diſtreſſed ſinner, inwardly feeling the into lerable bitterneſs, and heavy load thereof, addeth unto outward unrebukableneſs according unto the Law, an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal conformity unto the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>It is called Legal, not ſo much in reſpect of the means, whereby it is wrought; <hi>ſcil.</hi> the Law; for it is wrought not only by the Law, but alſo by the Goſpel: but in reſpect of the ſtate wherein the perſon is, in whom it is wrought, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding preparatory repentance: namely, under the Law, and not under grace.

Ignorance is taken away by illumination; pleaſure in ſin, is abated by ſorrow for ſin, that is, trouble of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: Boldneſs in ſinning is abated by the fear of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: whence followeth a kind of abating the contumacy of the will, like a ſtone that is broken, though it yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains a ſtone.

Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial, and preparatory hope of the change of the heart by grace, is increaſed by our reſtleſneſs in our preſent condition, and occaſioning an application of our ſelves to the obtaining of mercy in the uſe of means.</p>
               <p>Loſtneſs is a principal part of Preparatory Work,<note place="margin">A loſt Eſtate.</note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the ſoul beſides the Work of the Law, is further made ſenſible of its periſhing condition, by the common work of the Goſpel.

That we know not how to find our way again. 3. That we perceive both. The two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer are manifeſt: the third, namely, that Jeſus Chriſt doth in ſome meaſure make the Soul ſenſible of its loſt eſtate before he findeth it, appeareth thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ephraim</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> the ten Tribes) being in Exile, at length confeſſing and lamenting his rebellion, ſtubbornneſs, and the juſtneſs of the Chaſtiſement of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Captivity, ſeeth the neceſſity of Converſion; hereupon maketh his moan and prayer to God, <hi>Turn thou me, and I ſhall be turned, Jer.</hi> 31.18. which evidently implyeth a foregoing ſenſibleneſs that he could not turn, that is, convert himſelf.</p>
               <p>The Jews in the Captivity of <hi>Babylon</hi> (a figure of the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity of ſin) as they were abundantly ſenſible of their inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to deliver themſelves out of <hi>Babylen</hi> before God return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Captivity, ſo were they ſenſible of the great Truth figured thereby, namely, their periſhing condition under the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:118295:89"/>captivity of ſin, before God doth put into them the ſpirit o life, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.11.</p>
               <p>Thoſe ſinners, over whoſe repentance there is joy in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, are ſuch ſinners, who before they repented, felt a need of repentance, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.7. The other ninety nine; and that one, cannot be oppoſed in reſpect of the ſimple neceſſity of repentance, (for that was the condition of them all, they were all without it, and ſo all needed it,) but in reſpect of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibleneſs of the need of repentance: ſo only, that one need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, but the ninety nine are ſaid to need no repentance, that is, not to be ſenſible of their need of it.

               <p>The younger ſon, who is a type of the ordinary way of Gods bringing home Souls unto Chriſt, is not only in a loſt condition, which was common to the elder ſon with him, but is alſo ſenſible of his loſt condition, before he is found; <hi>Luke</hi> 15.24. <hi>This thy ſon was dead, and is alive again; he was loſt, and is found:</hi> And verſ. 32. <hi>For this thy brother was dead, and is alive; and was loſt, and is found. He was loſt,</hi> that is, he was ſenſible of his loſt eſtate. For, 1. He felt his periſhing condition for want of bread, that is, for want of Chriſt the living bread, <hi>John</hi> 6.51. as alſo, that for him to be ſupplyed with this bread, was in his Fathers, not in his own power, verſ. 18. Secondly, Becauſe the oppoſition between the elder and the younger brother, is not in reſpect of their loſt eſtate, abſolutely conſidered, in which regard they were both alike; but in reſpect of the ſenſibleneſs of their loſt eſtate, in regard of which they were unlike; the younger be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſenſible of his condition, the elder not, but thinking him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be well. Under this Work of the Spirit we are like
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:118295:89"/>the loſt groat, the loſt ſheep; and the loſt ſon. Like the loſt groat, in reſpect of our impotency to return, being lifeleſs creatures: Like the loſt ſheep, in reſpect of our indſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to return, being wandering creatures: Like the loſt ſon, in reſpect of our oppoſition to return, and ſenſibleneſs of all, being reaſonable and corrupt creatures.</p>
               <p>Inſenſibleneſs of our loſt eſtate, cannot conſiſt with that trouble of ſpirit that the Scripture evidently holdeth forth in Preparatory Work. Sin unſeen grieveth not: That which the eye ſeeth not, the heart rueth not. If as ſoon as our ſin is ſeen, we can help our ſelves, either our grief will be none, or much leſs then Gods ordinary diſpenſation in preparatory Work admits: <hi>Thou haſt found the life of thine own hand, therefore thou waſt not grieved, Iſai.</hi> 57.10.</p>
               <p>Inſenſibleneſs of our loſt eſtate cannot conſiſt with that thirſt, hunger, nor with thoſe ſighs, groans, tears, prayers, which the Scriptures manifeſt to be in thoſe, that under Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory Work, mourn, and ſeek, and wait in the uſe of Means, until they obtain mercy. We cannot ſigh for that we feel not want of: We need not ſigh for that which is in our own power to help our ſelves with.</p>
               <p>This through ſenſibleneſs of our loſt eſtate, is wrought in us by the common Work of the Spirit, in the Miniſtry of the Goſpel; which, together with its revealing the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt in coming into the world to ſave ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, convinceth us of our indiſpoſition and oppoſition, inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and enmity to come unto him. <hi>When he is come, he ſhall convince the world of ſin, becauſe they beleeve not on me, John</hi> 16.7, 9. <hi>No man can come unto me, except it be given him of my Father, John</hi> 6.65. <hi>Except the Father which hath ſent me draw him,</hi> verſ. 44. <hi>And ye will not come to me, that you may have life, John</hi> 5.41. Whereby, finding that we who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly cut off by the Law, are alſo become morally impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, inſufficent, and averſe, to the undeſerved, free, and only tender of Salvation by the Goſpel: that we, who have will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully pulled upon our ſelves juſt miſery, do maliciouſly reject free mercy: that we, who were loſt before-by the Law, are loſt again by the Goſpel: the Soul now feels all hope with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:118295:90"/>out Chriſt, to be taken away all tenders of grace; to be occaſions, convictions, aggravations of unbelief, and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence: and hereupon perceiveth, and yeilds it ſelf, to be doubly loſt, utterly loſt: and out of meaſure vile. So, as in this condition, the Command to believe, with the Promiſes of grace; fall heavier upon the ſoul, then the Command and Promiſe of the firſt Covenant: in that Goſpel doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the Law.</p>
               <p>Our diſobedience to the Goſpel, ſo far exceeds in evil, our diſobedience to the Law, as the Goſpel tranſcends the Law.</p>
               <p>The Soveraignty of God in this particular,<note place="margin">The Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty of God.</note> is his abſolute free Power to ſhew, or not to ſhew mercy unto man, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own good pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Gods making himſelf a Debtor unto his Elect, is the effect of his good pleaſure. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.18. <hi>We know not that we are of the number of his Elect, unto whom he hath made himſelf a Debtor, until we do believe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our perſonal, and practical Acknowledgement, That God hath power to deal with us according to his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, is a part of our humiliation.</p>
               <p>The Object of Faith,<note place="margin">Of the Object of Faith, with Arguments moving to believe.</note> is the Doctrine of the Goſpel; the Sum whereof is, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15.</p>
               <p>Arguments moving to believe, are,</p>
               <p>The Command to believe, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.23. <hi>And this is the Commandement that we ſhould believe in the Name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God's invitation of repenting ſinners to believe; for which end, he in Jeſus Chriſt, by the Miniſtery, ſtandeth at the door of our hearts, knocking there for entrance, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.20.

               <p>In this way we are to meditate of God, <hi>Look upon me, and be ye ſaved all the Ends of the Earth,</hi> Iſai. 45.22. <hi>I ſail, Behold me, behold me,</hi> Iſai. 65.1. <hi>As Moſes lifted up the Serpent in the wilderneſs, even ſo muſt the Son of man be lifted up: that whoſoever believe in him ſhould not periſh, but have Everlaſting life,</hi> John 3.14, 15.</p>

               <p>Seeking for Chriſt, is either without faith, in which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition we ſeek not Chriſt for himſelf, but for our ſelves: We ſeek rather the benefits of Chriſt, then Chriſt: we ſeek our ſelves, not Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 7.34, 36. and <hi>Chapter</hi> 8.21. Or with faith; ſo only believers ſeek Chriſt, and that for himſelf.</p>
               <p>Though they that have not faith, cannot ſeek Chriſt as they ought, but their very prayer is ſin; yet it is their duty to pray, and to ſeek after Chriſt. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 79.6. <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.25. <hi>Pour out thy fury upon the Heathen, that know thee not: and upon the Families that call not on thy Name.</hi> If the not calling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Name of God, be a ſin; then to call upon the Name of God, is a duty. <hi>Peter</hi> calls upon <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> though an unbeliever, to pray: <hi>Repent therefore of this thy wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart, may be forgiven thee, Acts.</hi> 8.22.

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> No: yet the more diſtinctneſs, the better: and ſome diſtinctneſs in reſpect of ſome of the principal parts thereof, according to the ordinary Diſpenſation of God, ſeemeth neceſſary: as namely, the conviction of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of ſin, the conviction of the guilt of ſin; <hi>i. e.</hi> that it juſtly binds over the ſinner unto puniſhment, impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of ſalvation by the Law, revelation of the object of faith: <hi>i. e. God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, and Jeſus Chriſt, God-man in one Perſon, ſet forth to be a Mediatour ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Goſpel of frec-grace.</hi> Some ſenſe of our loſt eſtate, looking up unto Jeſus Chriſt, not only as come to ſeek and ſave them that are loſt, but alſo as able to ſeek and to ſave, waiting upon him in a broken-hearted, and diligent uſe of means, until we be made partakers of his free ſaving grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. What meaſure of Preparatory Work is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to converſion?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> As the greateſt meaſure hath no neceſſary connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with ſalvation, ſo the leaſt meaſure puts the ſoul into a preparatory capacity, or Miniſterial next-diſpoſition to the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:118295:91"/>receiving of Chriſt. So that in reſpect of the Order of Gods Diſpenſation, ſuch a ſoul being called to believe, is not now to object againſt its believing. The defect of ſuch a meaſure of humiliation: but (together with its due attending to, and belping on any kindly work of a further degree of humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) it is to apply it ſelf in a principal manner, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to believe.</p>
               <p>There is not the like degree of humiliation in all thoſe that are converted:<note place="margin">Humiliatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis gradus no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eſt idem in omnibus illis qui conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuntur; alii enim gravi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> for ſome feel a greater meaſure of trouble, others a leſſer. But all that are truly converted are truly humbled.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 3. Whether may it not come to paſs, through want of light, either in the Miniſtery, or our ſelves, or want of due obſervation of Gods manner of working with the ſoul, or of due care to keep the manner of his working in mind: that a ſoul, which hath in its meaſure been made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of preparatory work, and ſincerely converted, may yet be unable, diſtinctly to call to mind its former experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſome principal part of preparatory work?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yes. But then theſe three things will follow.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Such a ſoul aſſents to, and cloſeth with the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Doctrine of preparatory work, being made known unto it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Such a ſoul aſſents to, accepts of, and walks in the practiſe of the humbling Doctrine of the Goſpel, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a Believer. The holy Chriſt-exalting, and ſoul-hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Doctrine of the Goſpel, virtually containeth, and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently preſuppoſeth the Spirit of Preparatory Work. The Spirit of Dependance and Repentance from falls and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drings, which ſtraying condition is called the loſt condition of a believer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.176. doth in effect include the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of the loſt eſtate of an unbeliever: inability with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out recovering grace to riſe from ſin to obedience here; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like our inability without converting grace: to riſe from death to life there. That is called humiliation; this humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. In the Work of humiliation which is before faith, the ſoul ſeeth that as it is nothing, ſo it can do nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt. Poverty of ſpirit in the regenerate, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.3.
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:118295:92"/>hath its proportion to poverty of ſpirit in the irregenerate, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.18. <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.17.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Such a ſoul muſt expect unſetlings, and as it were an after-bondage, before it cometh to be ſetled, and attain aſſurance of its ſalvation. Whereby God doth two things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Take off the Soul from its carnal confidences: for the leſs meaſure of experience of a loſt eſtate before faith, the greater meaſure of carnal confidence, and leſs meaſure of ſenſible dependance upon Chriſt after faith, until this cure.</item>
                  <item>2. God hereby provideth further for his own glory, by cauſing the ſoul to magnifie the Law, to condemn ſin, judge it ſelf, and exalt grace in ſuch a degree, as a kindly prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory work diſpoſed to. Aſſurance of ſalvation preſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, and the want of a kindly preparatory work, until now eclipſed.</item>

               <p>Qualifications are gracious Diſpenſations whereby the ſoul is in ſome meaſure rendred a more capable ſubject of faith, or converſion: and theſe diſpoſe the ſoul thereunto,<note place="margin">The Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the more difficult terms of the Queſtion.</note> either more remotely, as the remainders of the Image of God in man after the fall; which is called the grace of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: or more neerly, as the common works of the Spirit,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:118295:93"/>by the Miniſtery of the Law and Goſpel: theſe laſt properly come under the name of common ſupernatural grace, and are uſually called preparatory works.</p>
               <p>The Notion <hi>[Preparatory]</hi> is alſo carefully to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed: Works may be ſaid to be preparatory, either in reſpect of Gods ordinary Diſpenſation: ſo, thoſe diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which qualifie the ſoul with a greater Miniſterial capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, in order to converſion; are to us preparatory in the judgement of charity in all, and but in the judgement of charity in any. Or in reſpect of Gods intention; whence he purpoſeth ſuch a work as a means to, and a part of the way unto converſion, afterwards to be wrought by him. So, in the Elect unto God, they are are preparatory really: but unto us only (as they are alſo in the Non-elect) in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judgement of charity. Becauſe in that which is known they are alike, and that wherein they are not alike is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known.</p>
               <p>Briefly, Preparatory Work, is ſo; really, or in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of charity only. To God really, as concerning his Elect; to man in the judgement of charity only, as concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding becauſe we know that ſuch who are not elect, are partakers of this common work, and who are the Elect whom God will not forſake in this common work (as juſtly he may do all) we know not, until faith: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are to hope concerning all in whom we ſee them wrought (and to endeavour in the uſe of means according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,) that God will not leave the ſoul here, but that he will graciouſly proceed to the ingenerating of the grace of faith, in his accepted time: yet, being ignorant of his intent, we can but hope concerning any. Hence to us they are prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory in judgement of Charity in all, whether Elect, or Non-elect; and not in judgement of Certainty in the Elect themſelves before faith.</p>
               <p>Saving Qualifications, are taken either properly, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally; for ſome effect of ſpecial grace (ſuch as are the gifts of the Spirit in Vocation, Union, and Communion, all flowing from election) having according to the revealed
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:118295:93"/>Diſpenſation of God, that neceſſary and infallible connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Eternal life; whence ſalvation may be certainly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to the perſon ſo qualified.</p>
               <p>Or, Saving Qualifications are taken improperly: Firſt, Cauſally, <hi>viz.</hi> inſtrumentally; for the external means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a ſaving work is wrought: ſo that act of hearing the Word, by which faith is begotten in the heart, is called ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. 2. In reſpect of the purpoſe of God, and ſo all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious diſpoſitions, intended by God as preparative unto a ſaving work, afterwards to be wrought by him, are by ſome called ſaving But we are to know that a ſaving work in the two laſt ſences, (neither being ſaving properly, nor having a perſonal promiſe of ſalvation made thereunto, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore indeed is no ſaving work) falleth not under the compaſs of this queſtion.</p>
               <p>By Faith we are to underſtand the Faith of Gods Elect, which we ordinarily call juſtifying, or ſaving Faith.</p>
               <p>Concerning the varity of judgements,<note place="margin">The various judgements concerning the queſtion.</note> touching the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that qualifications before faith have unto converſion: Some erre on the one hand with the <hi>Enthuſiaſts,</hi> not giving them their due; by denying any preparatory uſe of them: more on the other, by giving them too much: we all being prone thereunto, by reaſon of that legal ſelf, the remaind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of which are yet dwelling in us; Albeit we take ſo much from Chriſt, as we overgive to them: whoſe differing te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets together with their gradual aberrations from the truth, and defections even unto the <hi>Pelagian</hi> hereſie, it may not be unprofitable in this place to take a brief notice of: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning with the laſt.</p>

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:118295:94"/>and more then converſion is with us) with the merit of congruity.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Arminians</hi> taxe the Orthodox,<note place="margin">Acta &amp; Scripta Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod. ubi ſupra <hi>Pemble.</hi> &amp; alii.</note> for aſſerting all acts before faith to be ſin; and teach that there is in a man not regenerate (that is vvithout faith) a hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs, a hatred of ſin, and ſuch other like acts, which ought to be accounted acceptable unto God, unto the communicating of further grace: that to all ſuch God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth ſufficient grace to believe; and leaveth it in the power of ſuch a ſoul, vvhether it will believe, or not.</p>
               <p>Others (vvith vvhom the fore-mentioned are not to be nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) reverend, learned, judicious, and pious (though they juſtly abhor the tenets of the fore-mentioned, yet) ſeem to teach, that there are ſome qualifications before faith that are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, vvhereunto faith and ſalvation may be aſcertained. This tenet (religiouſly premiſing all due reverence, and high eſteem in the Lord unto the perſons,) This diſcourſe, (I hope in the Spirit of Chriſt) craveth leave to examine, and alſo to propound the following conſiderations for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative; alvvays aſſerting, That it is our duty to encourage orderly to the uttermoſt to believe in Chriſt, and to hold forth the increaſe of hope, according as the preparatory work doth increaſe: yet, not ſo far as certainly to promiſe faith or ſalvation, or to deny, yea, or not to teach the ſoul before faith however qualified, to be the object of, and to lye under the <hi>ſi credideris,</hi> that is, the <hi>If you believe,</hi> of the Goſpel. So, as it remains a truth, concerning the Soul, yet without faith (however qualified) that if God ſhevveth it mercy, it is free and meer mercy; if he doth not ſhevv it mercy, he doth it no vvrong: and that his purpoſe to ſhevv, or not to ſhevv mercy thereto, is yet unrevealed.</p>

               <p>If it now be ſaid (for elſe I ſee nothing here that can be ſaid) that theſe ſaving qualifications before faith are effects of Election, and from Chriſt as acting in the way of his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:118295:96"/>grace; that Reply ſhall receive its Anſwer in the next Argument.</p>
               <p>Unto the perſon in whom there is no other qualification but that which is common (<hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as may be found in a Reprobate) Faith and Salvation cannot be aſcertained.<note place="margin">Argum. <hi>3.</hi>

               <p>But in an elect perſon, yet not a Beleever, there is no other qualification then what may be found in a Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.</p>
               <p>To make good this Argument, let us, 1. Shew the ground of the diſtinction of ſpecial or ſaving, and common grace. 2. Clear the terms. 3. Confirm the Minor; <hi>viz.</hi> that in an elect perſon, yet not a Beleever, there is no other qualification then what is the effect of common grace.</p>
               <p>The term Grace is uſed for common grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.3, 6. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.8. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.10. for ſaving grace, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.8. and elſewhere frequently, upon which places and texts equivalent (beſides the general conſent of Orthodox and learned Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) that diſtinction is ſufficiently founded.</p>
               <p>Common grace is that which thoſe that are not elected, may be and often are made partakers of.</p>
               <p>Special or ſaving grace is that which floweth from Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as an effect and argument of Election, and proper to the Elect.</p>
               <p>No effect of Election is before effectual Vocation, of the very form whereof is the grace of faith.</p>
               <p>Where is no life, there is yet no effect of Election; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no other but common grace. But where there is no faith, by which the Soul receiveth the Son, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.12. there is no life: Therefore where there is no faith, there is no other then common grace.</p>
               <p>The perſon who notvvithſtanding any qualification vvrought in him, is yet nothing in point of Salvation, is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of no other then common grace.</p>
               <p>But every Soul (hovvever qualified before faith) is nothing in point of Salvation: becauſe the Soul that is vvithout faith, is vvithout love; and the Soul that hath not love (hovvever qualified) is nothing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.2.</p>

               <p>But this Propoſition aſcertaining ſalvation unto a qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation before faith, is a Propoſition aſcertaining ſalvation unto a work, or as it were unto a work: Becauſe no action performed by an unbeliever can be an act of faith, their beſt actions muſt either be acts of faith, or not of faith; therefore works, or as it were works.</p>
               <p>A Promiſe of ſalvation made unto a Work (though not for a Work) in any perſon before faith is legal. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the perſon that is without faith, is under a legal ſtate. Therefore all his actions proceeding from him in that eſtate, muſt needs be legal. So of the Arguments, the Authorities follow.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Text, in that it ſeemeth to occaſion the moſt conſiderable Objection, calleth for the more diligence in the clearing of it. The Apoſtle, in anſwer to an Objection made in the perſon of the beleeving <hi>Romans</hi> (againſt the great ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of yeilding of themſelves unto God by obedience, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they were exhorted) taken from the fear of the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ſin, Chap. 6. verſ. 14. having encouraged them with an unanſwerable and aſſuring Argument taken from their preſent condition; 1. Negatively, <hi>for you are not under the Law:</hi> 2. Affirmatively, <hi>but under grace,</hi> in the ſame verſ. He (having alſo in the following part of the Chapter pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided againſt the abuſe of the latter part of his Anſwer, by removing an abominable Inference, erroneouſly gathered therefrom, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15.) in the beginning of the ſeventh Chapt. reſumeth the firſt, that is, the negative part of his Anſwer, concerning their not being under the Law; illuſtrating and carrying on his argumentation, by way of compariſon, fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the example of marriage, obliging the wife unto her husband during the term of his life, and no longer.</p>
               <p>In this Compariſon the Law (that is, the dominion of the Law) is compared to the husband, the Soul unto the wife; its two parts you have thus. The firſt part of the Compariſon or Propoſition: The wife freed from the dead husband, ſhe being freed is marryed unto another, being marryed ſhe bringeth forth fruit. The ſecond part of the Compariſon or Reddition: The Soul dead to the Law (that is as much as freed from her dead husband,) the Soul freed is marryed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, the Soul marryed unto Chriſt bringeth forth fruit unto him.</p>
               <p>Where obſerve the Apoſtle, notwithſtanding the matter in framing the Compariſon rather led him to ſay <hi>[the Law being dead,]</hi> as appears upon the comparing the firſt, fourth, and ſixth <hi>verſes;</hi> yet (the ſence remaining the ſame) he rather uſeth this phraſe <hi>[we being dead to the Law,]</hi> the better to decline (as judicious Interpreters conceive) the offence of
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:118295:101"/>the Jews, who being over-addicted unto the Law, would more difficulty have endured that phraſe, of <hi>the Law being dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From the two firſt members of the Reddition, the Objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ariſeth thus: If in the order of our ſpiritual Marriage the Soul is dead unto the Law before it be marryed to Chriſt, then there is a parting with all, a cutting off from, or dying unto ſin, and conſequently a ſaving qualification before faith.</p>
               <p>But ſo it is in order of our ſpiritual Marriage, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.4. Therefore.</p>
               <p>Thus we have the Objection with its riſe; for the further and full ſatisfaction whereof; Conſider,

                     <item>1. By <hi>the Law</hi> in this place we are to underſtand the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of the Law over a ſinner; hence it is compared to a hard and cruel Maſter, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. to a hard or cruel husband, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. beg.</item>
                     <item>2. The dominion of the Law hath divers acceptions in the Scripture, and is taken ſometimes for that power of the Law, whereby as an occaſion it provoketh and ſtirreth up the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the heart in the irregenerate: <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.8. <hi>But ſin taking occaſion by the Commandment, wrought in me all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of concupiſcence.</hi> Sometimes for the accuſing and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory ſentence of the Law: Sometimes for the rigor, whereby it exacteth perfect, perſonal, and conſtant obedience, by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that principle wherein we were created after the Image of God, and that for our Juſtification.</item>
                     <item>3. That the dominion of the Law in the firſt ſence, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that power of the Law occaſionally and by accident to provoke and ſtir up ſin in the irregenerate, is the dominion intended in this place, is manifeſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.5, 8, 9. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.14, 15. from the joynt conſent of Interpreters, that the Law is to be taken in the ſame ſence in both theſe places: It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be interpreted of the dominion of the Law in either of the two laſt ſences. That dominion of ſin, which death un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Law here mentioned freeth us from, is the dominion of the Law here intended: But the death unto the Law here mentioned, freeth us from the dominion of the Law in the

               <p>This Text then rightly underſtood, affirmeth that which none denyeth; namely, that a Beleever is dead to ſin, before Marriage-union between Chriſt and the Soul; that is, before the act of faith: for Marriage-union is not without the act of faith on our part; which alſo is acknowledged by them with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this diſcourſ argueth: But it doth in no caſe affirm (which muſt be carefully attended to) that we are dead to ſin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the grace of faith.

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:118295:102"/>infers the death of ſin, the immediate effect thereof: as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of life, expelled death in the <hi>Shunamites child,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>The Sum is, That before our Marriage union with Chriſt, (I mean before in order of nature, not in time) there is, firſt, The grace of faith. 1. The death of ſin. 3. The act of faith, and this laſt according to your own grant; before the act of faith, is both the grace of faith, and the death of ſin: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the death of ſin, is the grace of faith: Before the grace of faith, nothing that is ſaving.</p>

               <p>The Sum of this Anſvver is: The Text (in that it is a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable) through our infirmity, is the more apt to ſuffer by a miſ-interpretation.

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This Objection is already anſwered in the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Notion <hi>[Preparatory,]</hi> in the explication of the terms: where you may pleaſe to ſee it. Thus to argue, is as if you ſhould thus ſpeak, God intends this work pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, (in it ſelf common) unto which he hath made no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of ſalvation, as a means unto a further work. Saving, yet to come, unto the which he hath promiſed ſalvation: therefore, this preparatory work preſent, is ſaving. Or, as if (in other words) you ſhould ſay God intends to do ſuch a good, therefore he hath done it; God intends it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath promiſed it, that is, revealed his intent; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the truth is, God having but intended it, therefore he hath not revealed it. Who ſeeth not in this reaſoning, not only a <hi>Non-ſequitur,</hi> but an implyed contradiction.</p>
               <p>The Event in a perfect birth ſheweth that God intended the formation thereof, when it was yet but an <hi>Embrio,</hi> as preparatory unto the infuſion of a reaſonable ſoul.</p>

The whole argument granted concludes not the preſent queſtion: The queſtion is not Whether there be a ſaving work that is not a ſanctifying work, but Whether there be a ſaving work before the grace of faith.

               <p>An Object properly ſo called,<note place="margin">An Object in general, What? Objectum eſt, circa quod res, vel rei operatio ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatur. The Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Object of Faith.</note> is that; about which, the operation of a thing is primarily excerciſed: and unto which it is of it ſelf naturally ordered, and directed. So Truth is the Object of the underſtanding: Good is the Object of the Will.</p>
               <p>The Object of Faith is either univerſal, <hi>ſcil.</hi> the whole revealed Will of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.14. <hi>Believing all things which are written in the Law, and the Prophets:</hi> Or ſpecial, <hi>ſcil.</hi> the Goſpel, or revealed ſaving Will of God: and this is either Primary, <hi>viz. God himſelf, Father, Son, and Holy Ghiſt, and Jeſus Chriſt God-man propounded with a Command to believe,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.23. And a <hi>Promiſe of Salvation to them that do belieeve, Mark</hi> 16.16. Or Secondary: namely, The good obtained by believing: which, becauſe it is contained in the promiſes, therefore the promiſes are called the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary Object of Faith. As a Spouſe is firſt married to the perſon, <hi>i. e.</hi> her Husband, before ſhe enjoyeth any conjugal
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:118295:108"/>communion with him: ſo, we firſt by faith, receive the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Chriſt, before we are made partakers of the benefits of Chriſt, beſtowed upon believers.</p>
               <p>Union precedes communion. God and Chriſt are the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our Faith; the Benefits following upon Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, are the effect and end of our faith.</p>
               <p>The Special, Primary,<note place="margin">What the Special, and Primary Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Faith is.</note> and next Object of ſaving Faith may briefly be conceived under this Propoſition; <hi>viz.

               </p>
               <p>The Special and Primary Objects of ſaving Faith more largely conſidered, is that gracious Truth, and Teſtimony of God concerning Chriſt; whereby, he is tendered as a free, and ſufficient Saviour to every one that heareth, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth it: with a Command to believe, and a Promiſe, <hi>That whoſoever believeth ſhall be ſaved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Propoſition concerning the Object of Faith contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in it theſe particulars.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>That the Merit of Chriſt is all ſufficient,</hi> i. e. <hi>of ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent virtue to have ſaved all men.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>That God doth ſeriouſly tender Jeſus Chriſt, as a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Saviour to all unto whom the ſound of the Goſpel cometh.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. <hi>That every one that heareth the tender of the Goſpel, is bound to believe.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. <hi>That all that hear the Goſpel, are Miniſterially, equally, capable of believing.</hi>

               </list>
               <p>This Truth concerning Chriſt, about which ſaving Faith is firſtly, and immediately exerciſed, is by judicious Divines properly called the Object of Faith: the Goſpel, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15, 16. <hi>Go ye into the world, and preach the Goſpel to every creature; He that believeth, and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved.</hi> The Teſtimony, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.11. <hi>And this is the record that God hath given to us, Eternal life, and this life is in his Son.</hi> The Word of Promiſe, and ſaving Faith, or the efficatious Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Promiſe are Relates: Hence Faith is compared to a Seal, <hi>John</hi> 3.33. <hi>He that hath received his teſtimony, hath ſet to his ſeal, that God is true.</hi> As the impreſſion upon
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:118295:109"/>the wax, anſwereth to the character of the ſeal: ſo faith anſwereth the truth of this teſtimony, or promiſe. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is the mouth of Chriſt, faith is the mouth of the ſouls: by this act of faith upon the object of faith, Chriſt and the ſoul kiſs one another, <hi>Kiſs the Son, Pſal.</hi> 2.12. As alſo by the reflex act of faith, upon the teſtimony of his love by the Spirit: <hi>Let him kiſs me with the kiſſes of his mouth, Cant.</hi> 1.2. By faith they ſaluted the promiſes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13.</p>
               <p>Here take ſeaſonable and juſt notice, That Election, or Gods Intent concerning his Elect in the Work of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is no part of the primary Object of ſaving Faith. The Rule of Faith, as it bindeth all, is the firſt object of faith. As the Command, not the Decree is the rule of that obedience that floweth from faith, ſo the Command, not the Decree is the rule of the obedience of the grace, &amp; exerciſe of faith it ſelf: for the better underſtanding whereof, compare that act of ſaith, whereby we believe in Jeſus Chriſt, a ſufficient. Saviour to every one that believeth in him (which containeth the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of faith) with the act of faith, whereby we believe in Jeſus Chriſt, intended of God to be a Saviour unto us (or believe that we are elected, or that we are redeemed, or that Chriſt died for us, which all with others of like nature, are the ſame in effect, containing ſomewhat of Election of Gods Intent concerning his Elect, in the Work of Redemption,) and their difference will appear in reſpect, firſt, of their object.</p>
               <p>The firſt propounds Chriſt as the actual exiſting cauſe of ſalvation to the unbeliever believing.</p>
               <p>The ſecond propounds the Intent of God, or Chriſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our ſalvation: The firſt holdeth out our duty, but not the certain intent of God concerning our eſtate: The holdeth forth purpoſely the certain intent of God concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our eſtate. The firſt holdeth forth a remedy, <hi>ſcil.</hi> the object to be believed in by a ſinner, that he may be juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: the ſecond holdeth forth conſolation unto a ſinner ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified. The firſt is faith in Chriſt; the ſecond is a faith concerning Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Theſe acts of faith differ in reſpect of their ſubjects: the firſt is principally in the Will, though it be
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:118295:109"/>alſo in the underſtanding; the ſecond is principally in the Underſtanding, though it be alſo in the will.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, They differ in reſpect of Order: we firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt a Saviour, before we can believe that God intended Chriſt to be a Saviour unto us.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, They differ in reſpect of time: The firſt looks at Chriſt, as one who is preſent; the ſecond looks at the Intent of God, and Chriſt, which is a thing that is paſt.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, They differ in their nature: The firſt giveth us our being in Chriſt, or (at moſt) extends not beyond our being in, and union with Chriſt: the ſecond is the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of what is done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> Divines frequently teach, That Chriſt propounded in the ſimple term <hi>[Chriſt]</hi> neither containing truth, nor falſhood, is the Object of Faith; and not Chriſt held forth in a Propoſition. Suppoſe ſuch as is before expreſſed; <hi>viz.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt a Saviour unto all believers, and conſequently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me believing: or any other to the like effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Object of Faith is conſidered two wayes:<note place="margin">Objectum fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dei appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur illud quod creditur; vel illud de quo aliquid cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditur: quod creditur eſt propoſitio, vel enuntiabile: de quo creditur, eſt res ſimplici termino ſignificata. Objectum dupliciter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideratur, ex parte rei credita; &amp; ſic Objectum ſidei eſt ſemper aliquid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complexum: vel ex parte credentis; &amp; ſic Objectum ſidei, eſt illud enunti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abile, quod de illa re ſides apprehendit.

                  </note> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in reſpect of the thing believed: ſo the Object of faith is the thing it ſelf (concerning which the Propoſition of faith is formed) propounded in a ſimple term, wherein there is neither a truth, nor falſhood, as Chriſt; Creation, Reſurrection, &amp;c. Or in reſpect of the Believer; and ſo the Object of Faith is the thing which is to be believed, held forth in a Propoſition: as, that Chriſt is a Mediatour, and Saviour, that Chriſt ſhall come to judgement, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The preſent diſcourſe acknowledging both conſiderations. I chuſe to ſpeak in the latter, as being more eaſie to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the Reader.</p>

                  <item>1. It is ſuch as remaineth a truth concerning every one that heareth it.</item>
                  <item>2. It is ſuch, the participation whereof, every hearer is in equal, Miniſterial capacity of preparatory work (which is common both to the Elect and Reprobate) being alike in them.</item>
                  <item>3. It is ſuch as that all who hear the Goſpel, (preparato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry work being alike) are equally bound to believe.</item>
                  <item>4. 'Tis ſuch as miniſters unto <hi>Judas</hi> in caſe of belief, as much cauſe to hope in reſpect of the Promiſe, as unto <hi>John:</hi> and leaveth <hi>John</hi> in caſe of unbelief, in as much cauſe to deſpair in reſpect of the curſe, as <hi>Judas;</hi> that is, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the uſefulneſs of the Doctrine of the Decree in general: Here is no more place for Arguments either of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, or diſcouragement from perſonal Election, or Reprobation, then if there were no Decree.</item>

               <p>Such as atteſts unto the formidableneſs and danger of the guilt of the leaſt ſin, (and alſo of greater ſin proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly) in the offender, whileſt it teſtifies the greateſt ſins to be abundantly pardonable unto the penitent Believer: it takes away from the impenitent all occaſion to preſume; from the penitent all occaſion of deſpair. Sin appears no where more, nor no where leſs then in the Goſpel. There is a Myſtery of Wiſdom in propounding this part of the Myſtery of the Goſpel; namely: the firſt Object of ſaving Faith unto a Soul as yet not effectually called ſo as all, and only the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent truth, may be ſpoken without any errour on the one hand, or on the other; either concerning the Decree, Chriſt, the Perſons called to believe, the Condition of thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or Motives to believing.</p>

                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:118295:110"/>Not Gods pleaſure what ſhall be, but his pleaſure what ſhall be our duty, together with our obligation, is the ground of the Command. There is a double neceſſity, either of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action, or of infallibility. The Decree puts upon men a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of infallibility, not of coaction, or compulſion.</p>
               <p>Neceſſity of infallibility doth not prejudice liberty. God is neceſſarily good, yet freely good: he is goodneſs it ſelf, and perfection it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Man acts as freely, as if there were no Decree, yet as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly, as if there were no liberty.

Liberty is the effect of the Decree; ſo far is the Decree from prejudicing liberty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> How can they have hope to believe, whom God hath decreed ſhall not believe?</p>

We are (according to ordinary diſpenſation) to look at all living under the Goſpel as elected in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of charity. 'Tis the duty of every one to whom the Object of Faith is propounded to believe: and 'tis the duty of every Believer to believe that he is elected.

                  <hi>That God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, is of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Saving Faith.</hi> No man was ever ſaved without this faith, no man ever called upon God, but by the help of the Holy Ghoſt. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.3. <hi>As no man can ſay, that Jeſus is the Chriſt, ſo neither can any man ſay that God is God, but by the Foly Ghoſt.</hi> Neither did God ever hear any man that called upon him for ſalvation, but for his Sons ſake.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt God-man is of the Object of Faith, and therefore to be believed in.</hi> John 14.1. <hi>Believe alſo in me,</hi> Acts 16.31. <hi>And they ſaid, Believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be ſaved, and thy houſe.</hi> Acts 20.21. <hi>Teſtifying both to the Jews and alſo to the Greeks repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Acts 2.18. <hi>That they may receive forgiveneſs of ſins, and inheritance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them that are ſanctified by faith in me.</hi> We are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to believe in Chriſt, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.23. <hi>And this is his Commandment, that we ſhould believe in the Name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> By Jeſus Chriſt, we are not to underſtand the divine and humane nature only, but that Perſon that conſiſts of both Natures; that is, Jeſus Chriſt, God-man.</p>
               <p>Becauſe the Man Chriſt Jeſus, is God: As none can be the formal, primary, and proper Object of Faith, but he that is God, faith being a part of divine moral worſhip, and therefore giving divine honour to him in whom we do believe: ſo, it is alſo manifeſt, that he that is God, is to be believed in: it being evident from the Nature of God, that whoſoever rightly knoweth him muſt forthwith ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that he is abſolutely to be believed in, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what he reveals. <hi>They that know thy Name will put their truſt in thee, Pſal.</hi> 9.10.</p>
               <p>Becauſe as God-man he is our Saviour.</p>
               <p>This is a great part of the difference between the firſt, and the ſecond Covenant. The Object of Faith in the firſt Covenant, was God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt:
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:118295:112"/>but not Jeſus Chriſt, God-man, Mediatour. The Object of Faith in the ſecond Covenant, is both God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt; and Jeſus Chriſt God-man Mediatour. In the firſt Covenant man might have believed in God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out believing in Chriſt: but man could never believe in Chriſt without believing in God. Hence <hi>Paul</hi> deſires to know nothing but Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Our communion is by Faith in the Son of God. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>And the life which I now live in the ſteſh, I live by the Faith of the Son of God.</hi> Therefore, we have faith in the Son of God.</p>
               <p>As Chriſt is the Object of divine Worſhip, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.59. <hi>Revel.</hi> 5.12. of ſaving Hope, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.27. of our greateſt love, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.22. of our abſolute ſervice, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.9, 18. ſo he is the Object of our divine Faith.</p>

               <p>But the renewing us after the Image of God, according to which we were created in <hi>Adam,</hi> doth enable us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve: <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.24. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.10. Where there was a ſaving power, enabling to diſcern the revealed Will of God, and to put confidence in him accordingly; there was a power virtually to believe in Chriſt. But in <hi>Adam</hi> there was a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving power enabling to diſcern the whole Will of God, and to put confidence in him accordingly: Therefore in <hi>Adam</hi> there was a power virtually enabling to believe in Chriſt. As the Faith of the Angels in the firſt and ſecond Covenant
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:118295:113"/>differeth not habitually, ſo neither doth the Faith of <hi>Adam</hi> in the firſt and ſecond Covenant differ habitually.</p>
               <p>That which was implicitely, and by conſequence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the Moral Law, that we were ſome way enabled to yeild obedience unto: But Faith in Chriſt was command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed implicitely, and by conſequence in the Moral Law: by the firſt Precept, Faith in God is commanded abſolutely; therefore not only concerning what he was pleaſed to reveal at preſent, but unto what afterwards he ſhould be pleaſed to reveal. Juſtifying Faith is conſidered as commanded di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, and expreſly; or indirectly, and by way of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. So Faith in Chriſt is commanded in the Moral Law indirectly, or by way of conſequence.<note place="margin">Willet. on Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od. cap. <hi>20.</hi> Confut. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> It will not be denyed (ſaith Doctor <hi>Willet</hi>) but that this faith alſo (ſpeaking of juſtifying faith) is commanded in the Moral Law. Becauſe we are bound by the Law to believe the Scriptures, and the whole Word of God; for this is a part of Gods Worſhip, to believe his Word to be true. And here it is not unworthy our obſervation, that though Chriſt were not then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to be believed in, yet he was included in what was revealed under the firſt Covenant: For that threatening <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. <hi>In the day that thou eateſt thou ſhalt dye:</hi> is veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, as concerning the elect in Chriſt; who dye in their Surety, not in themſelves.</p>
               <p>If in <hi>Adam</hi> we were able to believe in Chriſt as our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver from ſin; and Confirmer in a ſtate of life (had Chriſt then been ſo propounded to us) there can no reaſon be given why we were not able in that condition to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in Chriſt as a Saviour from ſin, could he have been ſo propounded in that eſtate unto us.</p>
               <p>But in <hi>Adam</hi> we were able to believe in Chriſt, as our Preſerver from ſin, and Conſerver in that eſtate, had Chriſt then been ſo propounded unto us: Therefore, in <hi>Adam</hi> we were able to have believed in Chriſt, as a Saviour from ſin, could he have been ſo propounded unto us in that eſtate.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is proved, by comparing <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency with the elect Angels: the Image of God in them both,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:118295:114"/>being the ſame in kind, their abilities were the ſame in kind: as therefore the elect Angels by Creation, had a principle where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they were able to believe in Chriſt their Confirmer, (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by experience in that they believed in Chriſt their Head and Confirmer being commanded ſo to do) without the inſpiring of any new principle) ſo in like manner, had Chriſt been propound unto <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency, to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in as his Head and Confirmer therein, he by the ſame concreated Image of God with the Angels, was able there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by (through like aſſiſting grace) to have yeilded like obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence without a new principle inſpired.</p>
               <p>Either <hi>Adam</hi> was able to believe in Chriſt, or elſe God calling upon man to believe, requireth that of man which he never enabled him with a principle to perform; but it cannot be proved that God requireth that of man which he never enabled him to perform. Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Faith in Chriſt as a Saviour from ſin, and the ſtate of innocency, are inconſiſtent. Therefore, <hi>Adam</hi> had not a power to believe in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This proves that <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency could not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally believe; but not that he could not potentially believe: that is, that he had not a principle able (through aſſiſting grace) to believe in Chriſt; had the propounding of him been conſiſting with that eſtate.</p>
               <p>The cauſe of <hi>Adams</hi> not believing, was not through an effect of a principle enabling him thereunto, but by reaſon, firſt, of the inconſiſtency of juſtifying faith with that eſtate. 2. By reaſon of the not revealing of the Object of Faith. <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency had a principle ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling him to Parental duties, though he was never called thereunto, as alſo to duties of mercy and charity; which yet were inconſiſtent with that eſtate.</p>
               <p>The Saints in glory have a principle whereby they are able to perform the duties of repentance, mortification, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, (for ſure the ſtrength of grace is not weakened by being perfected in glory) yet is there no place for thoſe duties in Heaven. Chriſt (having received the Spirit out of meaſure) had a principle, whereby he was able to have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:118295:114"/>the ſervice of repentance, and mortification:<note place="margin">Molin.

                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. God is ſaid to harden our hearts, and to be the cauſe why we do not believe, <hi>John</hi> 8.47. and 10.26. and 12.39, 40. Wherefore it ſeemeth not ſo (at leaſt) to be our duty to believe, as that the fault of our unbelief lyeth whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon our ſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> For the better removing of this objection, there is need of a threefold Diſtinction.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Diſtinguiſh between unbelief, and unbelief not cured. 'Tis eaſie to conceive, how a Phyſician may be the cauſe why ſuch a diſeaſe is not cured: of which diſeaſe it ſelf, he is no cauſe. Unbelief conſidered in it ſelf is ſimply a ſin: Therefore, God is no way the Cauſe or Authour of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Diſtinguiſh of unbelief not cured: unbelief not cured, is conſidered either Negatively, for a meer abſence of faith, where the rule requireth it not to be, and therefore is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blamable: ſo it is in thoſe, that never heard of the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel. Or Privatively: for the abſence of faith where the rule requireth it to be; ſo unbelief is look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon in thoſe that live under, or hear of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Diſtinguiſh between a Phyſical, and a Moral cauſe: A Phyſical cauſe is ſuch a cauſe, as though without it the effect cannot be: yet, it is no ways bound to produce ſuch an effect: thus the abſence of the Sun is the cauſe of the night. A Phyſician is the cauſe why that diſeaſe remains un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, which he can cure: but is not bound to cure. A Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion the cauſe why the iſſue remains unhealed, which he is not tyed to heal. Thus the King not giving a pardon, is the cauſe why the offender is executed, whom no Law ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth him to pardon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:118295:115"/>A Moral cauſe is ſuch a cauſe wherein the Agent ſtands by duty bound concerning the producing, or not producing of ſuch an effect: ſo, as by omiſſion of what is command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or commiſſion of what is forbidden, there is a guilt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred: ſo mans will is moral, therefore the blameable cauſe of unbelief.</p>
               <p>Gods Will is the Antecedent, not the Cauſe of unbelief, the abuſe of mans free-will in the fall, is the cauſe of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. Unbelief not cured, (conſidered Negatively) is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Will of God a phyſical, and unblamable effect: of a phyſical and unblamable cauſe: but mans will being a moral cauſe; unbelief in this ſence cannot be the effect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Unbelief not cured (privatively conſidered) is in reſpect of God, as a blamable Conſequent, of an unblamable Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent: in reſpect of the will of man, it is a blamable effect, of a moral, and blamable cauſe.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Adam</hi> having received povver whereby vve might not have ſinned, vve ſinned freely.</p>
               <p>Unbelief is the effect of our ſin in <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God (together vvith the Object of Faith) tenders us means ſo far ſufficient to the begetting of faith, as leaveth us without excuſe. We love our unbelief, and reſiſt this means of believing, <hi>John</hi> 1.11.5.41.</p>
               <p>Our contumacious oppoſition to the command of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving is the effect of our love to unbelief.</p>
               <p>'Tis then but Juſtice in God to leave us to our unbelief, in ſo doing he doth us no wrong, being free to have mercy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom he will.</p>
               <p>The Difficulty of believing,<note place="margin">The Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</note> appeareth in three things.</p>

And to believe, is called the <hi>[the Work] John</hi> 6.29.</p>
               <p>No marvel therefore, if it be ſaid, <hi>'Tis eaſier to keep the whole Law, then to believe:</hi> Seeing by faith we receive Chriſt himſelf, and from him legal obedience imputatively; and aſſiſting power in our ovvn perſons practically, to fulfil all new obedience Evangelically.</p>
               <p>Becauſe alſo, there is more power required to make <hi>Adam</hi> a believer, then either to have created, or continued him in the ſtate of innocency: wherein, had he perſevered, he had fully anſwered the Law.</p>
               <p>The Grace of Creation (confirming grace being ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added) ſufficed to that: the Grace of Redemption is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to this. Gods pleaſure vvas enough without any coſt for that: but this, beſides the good pleaſure of the Lord,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:118295:117"/>coſt God his Son, and Chriſt his Blood; in that the Soul vvas a meer nothing: and ſo could do nothing for it ſelf; yet (being but a meer nothing) it made no reſiſtance: but here, beſides the helpleſneſs of a meer nothing, there is alſo the enmity of a moſt corrupt thing.</p>
               <p>The Believer obeyeth both Law, and Goſpel; we obey the Law legally in our Surety, the Goſpel perfectly in our ovvn perſons; with the perfection of parts, or ſincerely in this life; with the perfection of degrees in the life to come.</p>
               <p>Believers obey the Law legally in their Surety,<note place="margin">Legi ſatisfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimus in Chriſto juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficamur prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dita eâ juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia quam lex à nobis poſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat.

               <p>Believers obey the Goſpel perfectly vvith the perfection of parts.</p>
               <p>The Goſpel is the Law in Chriſt; the Rule of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is the ſame both in the Lavv, and in the Goſpel, though the manner, and end of obeying are changed: the manner of obedience under the Lavv was by the Grace of Creation, the manner of obedience under the Goſpel is by the Grace of Redemption; <hi>i. e.</hi> by the Grace of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>A great end of obeying under the Law, vvas, That vve might obtain life, as due unto us for perfect obedience there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, in a way of juſtice.</p>
               <p>The great end of obeying under the Goſpel, is thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe unto God for ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt, which glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of God in way of thankfulneſs, is a more effectual Motive unto obedience vvith a believer, notvvithſtanding the remainders of ſin: then the obtaining of life, (and that according to order of juſtice) was unto <hi>Adam,</hi> though vvithout ſin: as appears by the Apoſtacy of the one, and perſeverance of the other, through Grace.</p>
               <p>The means whereby faith is wrought, are twofold, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal,<note place="margin">Of the means of faith.</note> or Internal. External, <hi>ſcil.</hi> the Word (by divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution) the Inſtrument of Converſion: hence called the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:118295:118"/>Word of Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.8. Which moveth by propounding Arguments, and by perſwading, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. By Woing, <hi>John</hi> 3.29. By Commanding, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.23. it is by Divines commonly called a Moral Suaſion, or Moral Cauſe, acting only, by way of propounding the Object, (no cauſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, but improperly, and Metaphorically) it produceth not the effect, without the concurrence of the Spirit, vvhich is the Efficient Cauſe.</p>
               <p>The internal means is the ſupernatural ſaving, and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Motion of the Spirit, concurring vvith the Word of Faith, or (which is all one) with the Word of Grace: and in an accepted time, vvorking in the ſoul that faith, which the Word calleth for. Hence, called the <hi>Spirit of Faith,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.13. Whence, the Moral Suaſion of the Word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh effectual by the real perſvvaſion of the Spirit. The Word calleth upon us to believe, the Spirit cauſeth us to believe.</p>
               <p>The Word calls upon us to will, and to do; the Spirit of Chriſt worketh in us to will, and to do; the Word com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to be according to our duty, the Spirit vvorketh in us to be according to the Word. God in the Creation ſpake the Word, that ſuch a creature ſhould be; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal ſent forth a power, cauſing that creature to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Word: So whileſt the Angel reveals unto <hi>Mary</hi> the Conception of Chriſt, <hi>the Power of the Higheſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſhadowed her:</hi> Whence it vvas with her according to his Word. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.35, 38. So alſo, whileſt Jeſus cried vvith a loud voice, <hi>Lazarus come forth:</hi> there proceeded from him a Power, whereby <hi>Lazaras</hi> doth come forth, <hi>John</hi> 11.43, 44.</p>
               <p>The Miniſtery of the Word; whether Law, or Goſpel; is but a dead letter, and profiteth nothing without the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.7. <hi>Neither is he that planteth any thing, nor he that watereth, but God that giveth the increaſe.</hi> After all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, <hi>Timothy</hi> muſt vvait, if God peradventure will give them repentance, to the acknowledging of the truth, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.25. No Oratory, how excellent ſoever, can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with the blind to ſee, with the deaf to hear, or with
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:118295:118"/>the dead to live. God is not only an Orator,<note place="margin">Deus Autor non tantum Orator gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae. Twiſſ. de Elect. l. <hi>1.</hi> p. <hi>2.</hi> dig. <hi>6.</hi> Sect. <hi>16.</hi>

               <p>Which notwithſtanding: yet are we vvith diligence to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon God in the uſe of means; for though the means cannot work vvithout the Spirit, the Spirit (ordinarily) will not work (upon ſubjects of diſcretion) without the means. Man is a reaſonable creature, therefore God proceedeth with him by vvay of Arguments: but becauſe man is a dead creature, therefore he muſt work in him that which he perſvvades thereunto.</p>

               <p>Increated Grace is God himſelf, willing ſpiritual gifts freely unto men.</p>

               <p>Natural Grace, or the Grace of Nature, is that Image of God, according to which man was created: it is called grace, becauſe it is a free ſpiritual gift: Natural, becauſe concreated with, and infuſed into the Soul, ſo ſoon as it had its being in pure nature.</p>
               <p>The Grace of Nature, in Nature fallen, is the Remainder of the Image of God in the Soul after the fall, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14, 15. The <hi>Gentiles</hi> do by nature the things contained in the Law.</p>
               <p>Supernatural common Grace are ſpiritual gifts, flowing from God in Chriſt: whereof, thoſe who are not elected, are made partakers. They are called Supernatural, becauſe they are not attainable by the power of free-will, ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened with the Grace of Nature: and common, in that they are communicated to the Elect, and not elected. Such are gifts of Edification in the Miniſtration of the Oracles of God in Chriſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.10, 11. Gifts and Grace of Office in the Church. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.3.6. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.7.

               <p>Saving Grace (taken for that which is ſaving effectually, <hi>i.e.</hi> in reſpect of its efficacy) is an Impulſe or Motion of the Spirit of Grace, working from Chriſt, as a deſigned, or actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Head upon the Soul; ſo as it enables the Soul to yeild obedience in meaſure unto that Command; to the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence whereof it moveth.</p>
               <p>In it 4 things are diligently to be attended, and diſtinguiſhed.</p>

                  <item>2. The Motion it ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> a created tranſient act, which (notwithſtanding the effect thereof remaineth, yet it ſelf) ceaſeth, and paſſeth away, as the touch of <hi>Peters</hi> wives mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ceaſed, though the cure remained, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.15. The Angels motion upon the waters ceaſed, though the healing quality continued, <hi>John</hi> 5. The touch of the Loadſtone ceaſeth, the vertue yet abiding in the needle.</item>
                  <item>3. The Kind of this Motion is from Election from Chriſt,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:118295:123"/>as a Redeemer, and Head, either deſigned, or actually ſo, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the perſon ſo moved. It is not only from Chriſt who is a Redeemer, but from Chriſt as a Redeemer. 'Tis peculiar to the Elect, and its effect ſuch as accompanyeth ſalvation: in which reſpect it is called created ſpeciall grace: and is ſuch, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of none but the Elect (nor they until vocation) are made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of, &amp; that by the means of the word Saving Faith, and all other formal ſaving-grace, are the next effects thereof.</item>
               </list>
               <p>As Election, is increated ſpecial grace; ſo this, may be fitly called, created ſpecial grace.</p>
               <p>Saving Grace (which is formally ſo, and according to which ſence the words are ordinarily uſed) is a permanent effect, accompanying ſalvation; flowing upon ſuch an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual motion of ſpecial grace: whether upon the Soul, and imputative; as in juſtification, and adoption: Or in the Soul, and inherent; as in any other effect of Election; <hi>viz.</hi> Vocation, wherein is Faith, Sanctification, Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Glorification, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Saving Grace, is not only above the Power of the grace of nature, but alſo above the Power of ſupernatural com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon grace: and conſequently, not attainable by free-will,<note place="margin">Spiritus San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus non ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratur vel u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicum etiam gradu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fidei ſalutaris &amp; juſtificantis, in non electis Sph. ex de gra. univ. reſp. ad Erot. <hi>28.</hi> Habitus gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae &amp; gloriae in ipſo, &amp; in nobis, unius ſunt ſpeciei.

               <p>Saving Grace is of another kind: therefore ſpecially di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from all common grace, which may be found in thoſe who are not elected. The Holy Spirit doth not work ſo much as one degree of ſaving and juſtifying Faith in thoſe who are not elected.</p>
               <p>Saving Grace, is of the ſame kind, with the created grace in the Manhood of Jeſus Chriſt: the Manhood of Chriſt received of the Spirit out of meaſure. <hi>John</hi> 3.34. <hi>We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from Chriſt of that Spirit in meaſure, but he that is joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Lord is one Spirit.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. <hi>And of his fulneſs have all we received; and grace for grace, John</hi> 1.16.</p>
               <p>The Habits of Grace and Glory both in Chriſt and us, are of the ſame kind.</p>

               <p n="2">2. In reſpect of the Meritorious Cauſe: Saving Grace is from Chriſt as ſo meriting for them: common grace is from Chriſt who did merit, but not from Chriſt as ſo meriting; he did not ſo, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſavingly merit for them. Saving Grace is from Chriſt as a Redeemer of them, who are made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers thereof: Common grace is from Chriſt who is a Redeemer, but not from Chriſt as their Redeemer: ſaving grace is from Chriſt as a Head, unto thoſe who partake thereof: as a deſigned Head, in the gift of the firſt ſaving grace; as an actual Head, in the gift of following ſaving grace. Common grace is from Chriſt, who is the Head of his Body, the Church: but not as ſuch a Head unto them, who only receive thereof. <hi>Cain</hi> (ſaith <hi>Junius</hi>) was not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of a Saviour, as a Saviour: neither is any other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly man.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In reſpect of the next efficient cauſe: the next effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe of ſaving grace, is a motion of ſpecial grace; the next efficient cauſe of ſupernatural common grace, is a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſupernatural common grace.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In reſpect of the Subject: the Subject of ſpecial grace are only the Elect; the Subject of common grace are not only the Elect, but alſo thoſe who are not elected.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In reſpect of their formal Nature: the <hi>Genus,</hi> or next common Nature of ſaving grace, is a free-ſaving ſpiritual gift; its <hi>Species</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> its formal, or particular Nature) is its ſincere diſpoſing the ſoul to Evangelical obedience, as an inherent principle. Common grace neither diſpoſeth the ſoul to obedience, nor is it a ſaving gift.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In reſpect of its Efficacy: Saving grace reigneth, and quickens the new man; and gradually mortifieth the old man, until ſin be wholly expelled. Common grace is in this regard powerleſs, neither doing the one, nor the other.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, They are diſtinguiſhed in reſpect of their durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: common grace is mortal, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.29. Saving grace is immortal,<note place="margin">Free-grace What?</note> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23.</p>

               <p>By Created Free-grace (taken as is uſual for ſaving free-grace) we are to underſtand the Effects of Election: that is, the ſaving free-gifts of the ſpirit, <hi>viz.</hi> Vocation, Union, Juſtification, Adoption, Sanctification, Perſeverance, Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Freeneſs of Grace appears from the firſt cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the meer good pleaſure and will of God. <hi>For it is God that worketh in you both to will, and to do, of his own pleaſure, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip.</hi> 2.13. <hi>So then, It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth mercy, Rom.</hi> 9.16. <hi>Therefore he hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, ver.</hi> 18. <hi>The wind bloweth where it liſteth, and thou heareſt the ſound thereof, but knoweſt not whence it cometh; and whither it go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: ſo, is every one that is born of the Spirit, John</hi> 3.4.</p>
               <p>The Obedience of Chriſt is meritorious, not abſolutely in it ſelf, but by vertue of the Covenant of God, accepting his obedience as meritorious: <hi>i.e.</hi> as that, whereunto remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and ſalvation ſhould be due according to Order of juſtice. The Obedience of Chriſt was of ſufficient value in it ſelf, becauſe he was God, to redeem all mankind: but it could not be a price, <hi>i. e.</hi> a ranſom, further then as God was pleaſed to accept. The matter offered by <hi>Ahab,</hi> was of equal value with <hi>Naboths</hi> vineyard; but it could not be a price without his acception of it. And as the Obedience of Chriſt becometh merit through the acceptation of the good pleaſure of God, ſo the extenſion of this merit is enlarged, and bounded, according to the Will of God accepting it: for
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:118295:125"/>ſuch a number, neither leſs, nor more. Had there been more to have been redeemed, the Merit of Chriſt was ſufficient, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for the Redemption of the whole world: and if there had been but one to have been redeemed, his merit muſt have been infinite. It coſt Chriſt no more blood to ſave <hi>Manaſſes</hi> then to ſave <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt: no leſs to ſave <hi>Timothy,</hi> then to ſave <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Freeneſs of the Application of Grace, appears further from the Merit of Chriſt. Grace is given according to the Merit of Chriſt, not with any reſpect to mans merit of good, or demerit of evil. The leaſt ſin without Chriſt is incurable the greateſt ſin by Chriſt is curable. One ſting of the fiery Serpent was mortal without looking to the Brazen Serpent: and one look thereunto would cure a thouſand ſtings as well as one, ſuch is the demerit of ſin, as that it juſtly ſlayes the child that ſinned not after <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion: ſuch is the Merit of Chriſt, as that it juſtly ſaveth <hi>Adam,</hi> the great tranſgreſſour. No ſin is little in it ſelf, the Merit of Chriſt is infinite. 'Tis a great ſin for the leaſt ſinner not to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope, in reſpect of himſelf; as it is a great ſin for the greateſt ſinner to be without hope in reſpect of Chriſt. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal preſumption of mercy, becauſe our ſins are comparative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly little, leſſens the demerit of ſin. Deſpair of mercy, becauſe our ſins are great, leſſens the Merit of Chriſt A mans near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto, or remoteneſs from, the participation of grace (according to Gods ordinary Diſpenſation) is not to be judged, according to his Commiſſion of more or fewer ſins, but according to his proceeding in the preparatory work. A man may have committed many ſins, yet being Miniſterially diſpoſed, in reſpect of the receiving of Grace, he is near to ſalvation. A man may have committed fewer ſins, yet being without the preparatory Work of Law, and Goſpel; he is far from ſalvation. 'Tis not a mans former commiſſion of ſin, but his continuance in ſin, that keeps him far from ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>For the fuller clearing the deſcription of Free-grace, ſome Objections are to be removed: the former whereof concern the Freeneſs of grace in reſpect of Election; the other in reſpect of the Application of the good of Election; <hi>i.e.</hi> that good whereunto we are elected.</p>

God electeth, (that is, he willeth grace and glory to be applyed unto his people) without any reſpect of the Merit of Chriſt, as a Cauſe or Motive of that volition: but the actual Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Application of that grace and glory is for the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſake of Jeſus Chriſt. Chriſt is the Effect of Election, or of the Love of God; but he is the Cauſe of the ſalvation of the Elect. He is the Effect of Election, therefore called a Servant, and ſaid to be elect of God. <hi>Behold my Servant whom I uphold, my Elect in whom my ſoul delighteth, Iſai.</hi> 42.1.

               <p>Election is God himſelf electing, according to that recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and regulating Propoſition: <hi>Whatſoever is in God, is God:</hi> To ſay then, That Chriſt is the Cauſe of Election, or
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:118295:126"/>of the Love of God: were to ſay, There might be given a Cauſe of God; yea, that God is an Effect, and conſequently that God is not God. God hath ordained that the Merit of Chriſt ſhould be the cauſe of our ſalvation, but he hath not ordained that Chriſt ſhould be the Meritorious cauſe of his ſo ordaining: which implyeth a manifeſt contradiction.</p>
               <p>Chriſt then is the Cauſe of the gift of Eternal life, but not of Gods Will, to give Eternal life unto us. Chriſt is the Cauſe of ſalvation, but not of Gods Decree to ſave. <hi>Chriſt, Epheſ.</hi> 1.4. <hi>is made the Cauſe of Sanctification.</hi> And 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.9. he is made the Cauſe of Salvation: but he is no where made the Cauſe of our Election.

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Love of God is taken for the Act of Love it ſelf; <hi>viz.</hi> Election, or for the effect of his love; <hi>viz.</hi> Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Juſtification, &amp;c. Chriſt is the cauſe of the latter, not of the former: By Acceptation in this place, we are to underſtand Juſtification; of which Chriſt is the cauſe. He is the cauſe why we are juſtified, but he is not the cauſe of Gods Decree to juſtifie us. Gods ſpecial Love is his Will to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow all ſaving good upon us. All which good he willeth to us without Chriſt, as a cauſe of his volition: but not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt, as a cauſe of the application thereof. 'Tis the ſame Volition, or Act of Willing in God, by which he will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Being of a Mediatour; and the Salvation of the Elect for the Merits ſake of this Mediatour. The Salvation of the Elect, is not the laſt end of the Merit of Chriſt; but Gods Supream end is the Manifeſtation of the glory of his grace, in a way of mercy, tempered with juſtice: whereunto, both the Merit of Chriſt, and the Salvation of the Elect conjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are the means; and make one fit <hi>Medium</hi> thereunto.

                  <hi>Obj</hi> 4. Faith is a condition (though not of it ſelf, yet) of ſalvation, &amp; that in the Elect themſelves: therefore the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of ſalvation ſeems not to be free in reſpect of the Elect.</p>
               <p>

A Condition (properly ſo called) is a Law, or Obſervation, annexed to a buſineſs; the performance whereof lyeth upon the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; and accordingly the buſineſs becometh valid, or null. Such a condition was Works in the firſt Covenant. If Faith were ſuch a condition, there would ſoon be an end of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace: yea, the Covenant of grace, were indeed no Covenant of grace. A Condition improperly (ſo called, or a Conſequent Condition) is ſuch a condition, whoſe perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance by the Covenantee, is abſolutely undertaken for; and irreſiſtably wrought by the Covenantor, and not left in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence upon the Covenantee, to be performed by his own

So as this Propoſition, <hi>I will give Eternal life unto the Elect, if they do believe:</hi> is aequivolent unto this, <hi>I will out of my abſolute will give unto the Elect Eternal life, becauſe I will out of my abſolute will give unto the Elect to believe.</hi> The Condition of Faith depends not upon the Will of the Elect; either to be, or not to be; but upon the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and gracious Will of God.</p>

Where alſo note, That they underſtand not faith as we do; but define their faith, to be a general knowledge, and certainty, whereby they conclude the Word of God to be divine and true. The Sum of their Doctrine comes to this. To the natural man that doth what in him lyes, (eſpecially if he liveth under the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Goſpel) God will not deny the help of the firſt grace. The believer that doth what in him lyeth, merits with the merit of congruity, juſtifying grace, (<hi>i. e.</hi> habitual grace, according to them) The juſtified perſon may merit with the merit of conguity, the grace of perſeverance. The juſtified Perſon perſevering, may merit ſalvation, with the merit of condignity. The <hi>Arminians</hi> underſtand by grace; the conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ſupernatural grace, (yet that is but ſupernatural com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon grace) with free-will: So, as both concur together as co-working, joynt, partial, or fellow-cauſes of faith; as it is with a man and a boy drawing the ſameſhip together So as the work is not wrought by grace alone without free-will, nor by free-will alone without grace; but by both together. Whence it followeth, (according to them which they alſo affirm) that as much grace on Gods part may be put forth upon one that finally reſiſteth the motion of grace: as there is upon one that yeildeth obedience thereunto. And that the laſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive reaſon in ſuch a caſe, why one believeth, and the other believeth not, is from the free co-operation of the will of him that believeth. Little (upon point) do they herein give to grace, more then the <hi>Jeſuits;</hi> only, they judge better doctrinally of the nature of the grace of faith. The beſt of them make free-will and ſupernatural common grace, (<hi>i. e.</hi> Such as thoſe who are not elected may be made partakers of) to concur together, as co-working partial, or fellow-cauſes in the work of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. A doctrine which overthrowes grace, giveth unto fleſh, (that is to man yet without Chriſt) to glory, as a party-worker
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:118295:128"/>of ſaith (the total working vvhereof is proper unto Chriſt in the way of his ſpecial grace) and is repugnant both unto ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving grace, and Salvation it ſelf, becauſe the faith that is ſo wrought cannot ſave. To the Orthodox, this Propoſition: <hi>Faith is the Effect of grace,</hi> And this Propoſition, <hi>Faithis the effect of ſpecial grace:</hi> are equipollent. By grace, they underſtand grace peculiar and proper unto the Elect; therefore, flowing from Election, and conſequently from Chriſt, as their Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and deſigned Head; abſolute, irreſiſtable, and effectual; quickening the ſoul (until then) dead, by infuſing a principle of life: whereby, of unbelievers, they are made believers; and of unwilling, vvilling; in reſpect of which work, the ſoul (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding any ſupernatural common grace foregoing) is meerly paſlive: having no more cauſal power thereunto, then a dead body hath unto life.

Here diſtinguiſh between the increated Spirit which is the Author, the created tranſient gracious motion of the Spirit, which is the efficient cauſe, and ſaving grace, which is the permanent effect thereof.</p>
               <p>It is called the Spirit of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Why is it cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Spirit of Chriſt?</note> Firſt, Becauſe the Holy Spirit (to which the work of ſaving grace is eminently aſcribed, notwithſtanding it be equally wrought by all the three Perſons of the Trinity) proceedeth not only from the Father, but alſo from the Son, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.26. &amp; 15.26. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Becauſe the motion of the Spirit upon the ſoul, is from Chriſt as a Head, the ſame individual action proceeds both from the three Perſons (whoſe works upon the creature are undivided) and from Chriſt as a Head. In the actions of Chriſt as a Head, the whole perſon acts in way of office; the Divine nature principally, the Humane nature inſtrumentally.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Becauſe Chriſt hath merited the effectual ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Spirit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.14, 15.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Becauſe the Spirit works according to the wil of Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.21.26. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.26.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Becauſe the Spirit which we receive in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, is the ſame in kind, with the Spirit, which Chriſt (as man) received out of meaſure, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17.</p>
               <p>The ſoule by faith receiveth the perſon really and obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively, but not perſonally, it were blaſphemy ſo to affirm that is,<note place="margin">How the ſoul by faith recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Chriſt? <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> it apprehends the Perſon of Chriſt, the immediate; object of faith, is Chriſt himſelf; the Divine nature is in the three Perſons eſſentially. The ſecond Perſon of the <hi>Trinity</hi> dwelleth in the Manhood perſonally. The Spirit is in the Beleever energetically, or operatively, that is, by its ſaving effects.</p>
               <p>That by faith the ſoule receiveth the Perſon of Chriſt, appeareth thus; from the nature of Faith, whoſe very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſiſts in receiving of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:118295:130"/>To receive Chriſt Jeſus as our Lord and Saviour, is of the form of faith, and principally differenceth it from other ſaving grace, wherewith, in reſpect of its next matter it agreeth, we may as well deny a man to be a reaſonable creature, as deny that the ſoul by faith receiveth Chriſt, hence faith is called a receiving of Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 1.12. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.6. As therefore by the act of faith, the ſoule actively receiveth Chriſt, ſo by the habit of faith, the ſoul paſſively receiveth Chriſt.</p>
               <p>This appears yet further from the nature of Relates;<note place="margin">Fides per ſe eſt qualitas, ſed ratione reſpectus ad objectum, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catur relatio. <hi>Keck. Log. Lib. 1. Sect. 1 cap. 12.</hi>
                  </note> faith, and the object of faith (that is Chriſt) are Relates: faith in it ſelfe conſidered is a quality, but in reſpect of Chriſt the object thereof it is a Relate. Relates neceſſarily affirm one the other, they are together, not onely in time and nature, but in knowledge alſo; the one cannot be known without the other; as it is impoſſible to be a Son, without an actuall reſpect unto a Father; ſo it is impoſſible there ſhould be faith, without an actuall (I ſay not active) receiving of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>As it is a truth, <hi>That he that hath the Son</hi> (that is, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Son) <hi>hath Life;</hi> ſo it is a truth, <hi>That he that hath Life, hath the Son, becauſe he that hath not the Son, hath not Life,</hi> Joh. 5.12. But every Believer as a Beleever hath Life; (for it were a ſtrange thing even in notion, to ſuppoſe a dead Beleever) Therefore every Beleever hath the Son; He that hath Chriſt for his Head, hath the Perſon of Chriſt; But every beleever hath Chriſt for his Head (becauſe every beleever is a member of Chriſt, now a member cannot be without a Head) therefore every beleever hath the Perſon of Chriſt. As when God actually makes us his people, he actually makes himſelfe our God; ſo when the Lord Chriſt actually makes us his people, he makes himſelf our Lord, and Head; But in vocation he makes us his people. It is a confeſſed truth that beleevers are not made partakers onely of the gifts of Chriſt, but alſo of the Perſon of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>It holds forth a ſweet correſpondence with that truth <hi>Col.</hi> 1.18. <hi>That in all things he</hi> (Chriſt) <hi>might have the prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence,</hi> that we ſhould not be made partakers of any of his
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:118295:131"/>ſaving gifts before we are made partakers of his Perſon. <hi>How ſhall not he with him give us all things,</hi> Rom. 8.32. Not any ſaving thing given from him, without the gift of him.</p>
               <p>The ſoule reſts not in ſaying Vocation is mine, Juſtification is mine, Sanctification is mine; but in ſaying Chriſt is mine. <hi>Ruth</hi> had refreſhing in <hi>Boaz</hi> his kindneſſe, <hi>Ruth</hi> 2.14. but not Reſt, chap. 3.1. untill ſhe had <hi>Boaz</hi> himſelf. It is a Harlots practice, firſt to have conjugal communion, and then to be united, and married to the Perſon; But we firſt muſt be married to the Perſon, and then have conjugal communion.</p>
               <p>In Vocation we receive Chriſt, in union we are joyned with Chriſt in the ſame ſpiritual third Being, by commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion we receive from Chriſt, and returne unto Chriſt, now being ours and united unto us.</p>
               <p>By Vocation Chriſt is in us, by union Chriſt dwelleth in us, by communion he communicates the benefits of a Head unto us.</p>
               <p>As we receive the Perſon of Chriſt objectively, ſo we receive the Spirit of Chriſt formally.<note place="margin">What it is to receive the Spirit of Chriſt.</note>
               </p>
               <p>For the ſoul to receive the Spirit of Chriſt, is, for the ſoul ſo to be made partaker thereof, as to become the formal ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of that univerſal habitual created frame of inherent ſaving grace, or whole body of renewed ſaving qualities (of which before in the ſecond Particular) whereby we are made Evangelically conformable to the revealed will of God.</p>
               <p>This body of renewed ſaving qualities is infuſed by the Spirit of grace, in receiving whereof the ſoul is paſſive, as a veſſel is a paſſive receiver of oyl powred thereinto.<note place="margin">The Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</note>

                  <item>2 It affirmes Sin to reigne where Chriſt is, ſince where faith is Chriſt is, and where many graces are not, there the many contrary ſins reigne; except we ſhould ſuppoſe a middle eſtate of the Soule, wherein neither ſin nor grace reignes.</item>

Now all contraties (being repugnants in Nature) are uncapable of meeting together in the ſame ſubject, in their ſtrength, for a moment of reaſon, as well as for a moment of time.</item>
                  <item>6 It affirmes either that the habitual alteration of the Soule in all reſpects (that of its change from unbelief to faith excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) is not converſion, which is againſt reaſon; or elſe that the Soule is active, in reſpect of this alteration, and conſequently in reſpect of ſo great a part of its converſion, which is ſo farre contrary to the generally received Doctrine of the paſſiveneſs of the Soule in converſion.</item>

               </p>
               <p>Vocation is the infuſion of a principle of Life (or as ſome ſpeake, of the ſolitary habit of Faith,<note place="margin">Vocation, what?</note> in whoſe ſenſe this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition alſo ſtands good and untouched) by the Spirit into the loſt Soule (in meaſure ſenſible of its inability, and enmity to beleeve, repent, or doe any good) by the meanes of, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the external call of the Goſpel, in which worke the Soule (notwithſtanding any preparatory worke) is meerly paſſive, <hi>i. e.</hi> a meere paſſive receiver.</p>
               <p>This gracious, and ſaving work of the Spirit, infuſing life into the Soule, is called Vocation, by a Metonymie, <hi>i. e.</hi> a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, naming the work it ſelfe, by the name of the inſtrument, and external meanes, by which the Spirit works it.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Paſſiveneſſe, or ſuffering, is either Perfecting, tending to the good and perfection of the ſubject; ſo the Creature, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was nothing, ſuffered in receiving its being; the Life-leſſe body of <hi>Adam</hi> when it was made alive, the Soule of <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar,</hi> when his reaſon returned to him: Or Corruptive,<note place="margin">Paſſio Perfectiva, Corruptiva.

                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:118295:134"/>The paſſiveneſſe of the Soule, is the obediential ſubjection of a Soule Miniſterially prepared, wherein being unable to act, it only receiveth the impreſſion of the Agent.</p>
               <p>The Will in reſpect of this firſt reception of Grace, hath neither the nature of a free Agent, nor of a natural Patient, but of an obediential ſubjection.</p>
               <p>Obediential ſubjection, is that capacity in the ſubject, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an impreſſion from the agent, whereby as it remaines without ability in itſelf, to put forth any cauſal vertue, in order to ſuch an effect; ſo neither hath it any ſuch repugnancy, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction in its nature, whereby it is rendred uncapable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made partaker of ſuch an impreſſion, or effect, by the power of a ſupernatural cauſe.</p>
               <p>Briefly,<note place="margin">Impoſſibile Naturâ, Naturae.</note> there is in ſuch a ſubject, in order to ſuch an effect, an impoſſibility by Nature, but not to Nature; <hi>i. e.</hi> an impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility in reſpect of its owne power, but a poſſibility in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to a ſupernatural power; this was the condition of thoſe bones, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. in reſpect of Life; though there was in them a ſimple impoſsibility to live of themſelves, yet there was no impoſſibility but that they might be made alive, by the power of God. Power to receive a new forme is either Natural, or O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bediential; Natural is in the thing, or matter that is changed, as in the ſeed of an Herb, there is power to become an Herb; Obediential power of a ſubject to receive a new forme, puts not any cauſal power in the thing, or matter to be changed, all ſuch power is without it, viz. in the efficient; there is only a power of reception in the thing, or matter; all power of cauſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity being without the thing in the efficient. So ſtones are in an obediential power to become men, that is, there is in them a ſubjection to become Men; but all cauſality whence they doe become men, is without them, and in the efficient thereof, namely God.</p>
               <p>Obediential ſubjection is a capacity in the Creature, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the impreſſion of the firſt cauſe.</p>
               <p>For the Soule then to be paſsive in the work of Vocation, is for the Soule to receive the firſt ſaving grace, and ſupernatural effect of the Spirit of Chriſt; ſo as the Soule it ſelfe in this work is no way active, from any ſuch principle of activity as is
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:118295:134"/>of any power to produce ſuch an effect, no more than there is in a dead man to produce life;<note place="margin">Tho. 1, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The juſt diſtinction between the habit,<note place="margin">The juſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, &amp;c.</note> and the ſecond act or exerciſe of grace, is carefully to be obſerved.</p>
               <p>The ſupernatural power, principle, or habit, (for all thoſe termes mean the ſame thing) is the firſt act; the Life-operation is the ſecond act.</p>

The ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit is the will it ſelf; the Life-act is the volition. The habit is the inclining of the ſoule to the object of its action; the Life-act is the union of the ſoule with the object. In the infuſion of the habit the ſoule acteth not, but is onely acted;<note place="margin">Haminis vero primtsm paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio quòa tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hitur à patre; deinde act io quòu tractus venit ad Chriſtum. <hi>Jun.</hi> de nat. &amp; grat. collat. <hi>11.</hi> l. <hi>57.</hi>
                  </note> In the Life-act the ſoule being acted, acteth. The habit God worketh without us; the Life-act, God work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with us. In the habit of faith, is the being of faith it ſelf; the Life-act of ſaith, is the working of this grace now wrought. The infuſion of the habit is effectuall vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: The Life-act of faith, is our anſwer unto the call of God. Effectual vocation is called the drawing of the Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.44. our being taught of God, our hearing and learning of the Father, <hi>John</hi> 6.45. The Life act of faith is the ſouls immediate comming unto Chriſt, upon its being drawn, taught of God, and having
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:118295:135"/>heard and learned of the Father. By the infuſion of the habit, the immediate and irreſiſtable work of the Spirit of grace, God converteth the ſoul? By the Life-act, the ſoule being converted, converteth it ſelf unto God. By the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſion of the habit, God maketh us his people, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.23. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.10. By the Life-act, we avouch him to bee our God; we ſay it in truth, and lye not; we unſay it not again. By the habit, we are made good trees; by the life-act, we bring forth good fruit.</p>
               <p>The habit, or firſt act, doth not alwayes infer the ſecond; it may be without the ſecond; but the ſecond alayes ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the firſt. Two contrary habits may be together in the ſame ſubject, as grace and originall concupiſcence in the ſoul; heat and cold in the ſame water: but there cannot be two ſecond acts proceeding from thoſe contrary habits, at the ſame time. The habit is a principle inhering in the wil as its ſubject, and denominating it willing, after the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a quality; the life-act floweth efficiently from this principle, and is accountable to us, as a good act, unto which, God in his mercy hath appointed a reward.</p>

               <p>The habit of faith (which alſo holds in reſpect of any other grace) goeth before the ſecond act (commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the act, or Life-operation) or exerciſe of faith, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth thus, from the order of the firſt, and ſecond act; The habit is the firſt act, the Life-operation is the ſecond act: Firſt as before Second. The nature of the thing teacheth the being of grace (which is life it ſelf) to be before the vital operation of that grace; the grace of faith, is the being of faith it ſelf, called the Spirit of faith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.13.

But ſupernatural life-operations are creature-effects, whoſe principle is the ſame with an habit, as hath been cleared in the explication of an habit) therefore ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural life-operations preſuppoſe a principle foregoing ſuch acts. That ſupernatural life-operations are creature-effects is manifeſt; grace, the new-creature (whether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in part, or whole) is a creature.</p>
               <p>That creature-effects preſuppoſe a principle in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, formally, or virtually containing ſuch effects, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by this induction. All creature-effects, or actions, are either ſupernaturall, proceeding from a ſupernatural principle infuſed, or inſpired; or moral, whoſe principle is the Law written in the heart, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14. hence are actions of external conformity to the Law; or artificial, whoſe principle is right reaſon; or natural, which flow from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, or inſtinct.</p>

As the Image of God in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> (which conſiſted in conformity to the command) was his Spiritual life; ſo the Image of God created anew in the Soul, is life; either this is life, or what can be life? As the ſpirit of ſinne is the ſpirit of death, ſo by the rule of contraries, the ſpirit of effectual ſaving grace is Spiritual life; <hi>He that hath the Sonne hath life,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.12. But every Beleever hath the Sonne. From the nature of the grace of faith, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Jeſus Chriſt, as our Lord and Saviour, being of the eſſence and form thereof, as a natural principle of natural ſenſe, motion, and action, is natural life; ſo a ſupernatural principle, of ſupernatural ſenſe, motion and action, is ſupernatural life; But ſuch a Principle is ſaving faith, and each other ſaving grace. No Life-leſſe principle can enable the Soul to a Life-act, it cannot be reaſonably conceived how a Beleever (as a Beleever) ſhould not be alive. The ſumme is, this text holds forth an Active-quickning Chriſt, enlivening a dead paſsive Soul.</p>
               <p>So from Scripture, the Arguments follow, Firſt, from the ſupernatural nature of the Habit of ſaving faith, or of the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual frame of the New Creature.</p>
               <p>In receiving a ſupernatural Habit,<note place="margin">Theologi vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum infuſum per ſe, quiaper ſe &amp; ſua natus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra poſtulat ita, &amp; non alitèr fieri. suarez. <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raph Tom. poſt diſp. 44. ſect. 13 n. 6.</hi>
                  </note> or Principle, the Soul is paſsive; ſaving faith, or the habitual frame of the New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is a ſupernatural Habit, or Principle; therefore in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſaving faith, or the habitual frame of the New Creature, the Soul is paſsive. Supernatural is that which exceeds the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Nature, and is received of the Soul by way of inſpiration only, as the gift of Prophecy; or both, by inſpiration and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, as the habits of grace; ſuch habits, the Schools call, [Habits infuſed of themſelves] their very nature denying them to be otherwiſe attained; either by acts, or any created cauſe, whereby they are diſtinguiſhed from Habits infuſed by accident; ſuch as are the gifts of Tongues, and the gifts of
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:118295:139"/>healing; which though they are ordinarily acquired and gotten by acts of ſtudy, and practiſe, yet have ſometime been infuſed, as in the Apoſtles time.</p>
               <p>In receiving that ſupernatural ſaving habit, or principle, before which the ſoul hath received no ſupernatural ſaving habit, or principle, the ſoul is paſsive: But the grace of ſaving faith is ſuch a ſupernatural ſaving habit, or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple received, before which the ſoul hath received no ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural ſaving habit, or principle; Therefore in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ſupernatural ſaving habit or principle of faith, the ſoul is paſsive.</p>
               <p>From the nature of the ſubject of ſaving faith, which is wholly unable to confer any cauſative power towards the producing of ſuch an effect. In receiving a miraculous impreſsion, the ſoule is paſsive; but the infuſion of the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of faith, or principle of life in Vocation, or Converſion, is a miraculous impreſsion. Vocation is a miracle (it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no leſſe a miracle to raiſe a ſoul from ſpiritual, than a body from natural death) therefore in receiving the infuſed habit of faith the ſoul is paſsive; notwithſtanding God oft-times makes ſuch uſe as he pleaſeth of men in working a miraculous effect in them; yet becauſe in ſuch works, the whole efficiency alwayes flows from God, and none from man, Men are paſsive in receiving ſuch miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous effects or impreſsions. <hi>Moſes</hi> putting his hand into, and plucking it out of his boſome, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Naamans</hi> dipping himſelf ſeven times in <hi>Jordan,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 5.14. conferred no more power to the curing of their Leproſie, nor the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans touching the hem of Chriſts garment, <hi>Mark.</hi> 5.28, 29. to the healing of her iſſue of blood, than if they had done nothing.</p>
               <p>In receiving that ſaving power to do, before which, there is no ſuch active ſaving power, the ſoul is paſſive (we cannot do any thing, whilſt we are but yet receiving power to do) but in receiving the habit of faith, we receive that ſaving power to do, before which, there is no ſuch active ſaving-power. Therefore in receiving the habit of faith, the ſoul is paſſive.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="270" facs="tcp:118295:140"/>Vocation is compared to Circumciſion of the heart, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6. to Creation, to powring out of the Spirit (ſo is the habit of faith there called) <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.6. to quickning or making alive. As therefore the perſon circumciſed was paſſive in Circumciſion, the creature in its creation, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject quickned in its vivification, and the ſubject into which precious water is powred, is paſſive in reſpect of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter powred thereinto; So the ſoul in Vocation (which is all theſe ſpiritually, as being that work wherein the heart is circumciſed, quickned, hath inherent ſaving grace crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in it, and powred out into it, by the Spirit) muſt needs be paſſive. The contrary tenet makes us in the creation of faith to be our own creators in part. An aſſertion, as full of pride, as empty of reaſon; it makes us in part au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of our faith, a high degree of ſpiritual facrilege againſt the glory of Chriſt, and grace of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</p>
               <p>Obj. 1. <hi>The Soul before, and in receiving of grace, is active in reſpect of the uſe of means, therefore not meerly paſſive.</hi>

                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Paſſive is taken either abſolutely, for that which is ſimply paſſive, and in no reſpect active; ſo the ſoul is not paſſive; God doth not work ſavingly upon us, as upon ſtocks or ſenſeleſſe creatures: or it is taken reſpectively, for that which notwithſtanding in ſome ſenſe it be active, yet in ſome it is paſſive; the ſoule is paſſive in this latter ſenſe: it is active in reſpect of the uſe of means, it is paſſive in reſpect of any ſaving efficacie by the uſe of means. <hi>Sarah</hi> was active in reſpect of the uſe of means, yet paſſive in conceiving by the uſe of means, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.19. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.11, 12. the <hi>Shunamites</hi> childe (notwithſtanding any natural heat, and radical humor, yet remaining in its dead body) was paſſive in regard of the re-infuſion of the reaſonable ſoule, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 4.34. notwithſtanding the noyſe of the bones, there coming together, bone to his bone, the ſinewes and fleſh coming upon them, and the skin covering them, yet thoſe breathleffe bodies remaine paſsive in reſpect of life, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.7, 8.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>In Vocation, or receiving the habit of grace, there is a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical motion of the will, becauſe there is a gracious motion, which neceſſarily preſuppoſeth a Phyſical motion: Therefore, in Vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the ſoul is not meerly paſsive.</hi>

                  </note> but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the graciouſneſſe of that Phyſical act, the ſoul is meerly paſsive: To will is in our own power, to will as we ſhould, is of God.</p>
               <p>Obj. 3. <hi>Converſion (the ſame with Vocation) is a Life-act; to affirm the ſoule to be meerly paſſive in a Life-act were a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction; therefore the ſoule in Vocation is not meerly paſsive.</hi>

The form conſiſts in an indiviſibility, it is an indiviſible thing, tis not infuſed ſucceſſively,<note place="margin">Et quemad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modum in Chriſtum credere non eſt motus ſucceſsivus ſed inſtantaneus, ita &amp; inſitio noſtra in Chriſtum non eſt motus ſucceſsivus; ſed mutatio inſtantanea, <hi>Twiſſ.</hi> vind. grat. l. <hi>3.</hi> errat. <hi>8.</hi> Sect. <hi>1.

                  </note> or by parts; as natural life, ſo ſpiritual life conſiſts in an indiviſibility, <hi>i. e.</hi> it hath its being all at once, and is uncapable of diviſion into parts.</p>
               <p>Becauſe Vocation inferreth an eſſential change in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. There is a change in a ſubject, or of a ſubject; change in a ſubject, is either of quantity or quality, this is called an accidental change; Change of a ſubject, is an eſſential change, which in natural things is called Generation, in ſpiritual Regeneration. Now that every eſſential change, whether Phyſical <hi>i. e.</hi> natural, or ſpiritual, is in a moment, is thus evident. Generation is taken improperly for the way and preparation, or previous alteration which tendeth to the eſſence, <hi>i. e.</hi> the union of the form with the matter, ſo we ſay the Infant in the womb is generating ſome certain months ſpace, this is an accidental change: or properly, for the eſſential change, <hi>viz.</hi> the introduction of the form, ſo the Infant is generated in a moment; after that
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:118295:142"/>the matter is now ſufficiently altered, and prepared, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the form.</p>
               <p>An eſſential mutation, that is, the mutation or change of the ſubject, both in Nature and Divinity is wrought in an inſtant, becauſe it is rather the determination of a motion, than the motion it ſelf.</p>
               <p>As Generation properly taken, is a paſſive mutation of a natural body, whence from the union of the form with the matter, the body beginneth to be that which it was not; So Regeneration is a paſsive mutation of an elect ſoul, whence by reaſon of the union of grace with the ſoul, the perſon beginneth to be that which he was not.</p>
               <p>In that Generation is the acquiring of a new, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption is the laying down of an old form, therefore gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and corruption cannot be effected diviſibly, and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsively, or gradually; otherwiſe it would follow, that in the ſame thing, and in the ſame inſtant, there were either no form, or two forms, <hi>i. e.</hi> that ſome one thing were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or two things. In the moment of Converſion God works that bleſſed work which ſhall never be undone, that is wrought in an inſtant, which ſhall remain for ever.</p>

               <p>Of all other Unions, three are moſt eminent; the Union of the three Perſons in one Eſſence; this is the Myſtery of
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:118295:143"/>all myſteries. The Union of the two Natures in one perſon, in Chriſt; this is a great myſtery, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. The Union of a Beleever with Chriſt, and in him with God, This is a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, Eph. 5.32.</p>
               <p>The Union of the Mediator with the Father, who as God is one with him, both in reſpect of Eſſence, <hi>I and my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are one,</hi> Joh. 10.30. and in reſpect of will, <hi>Whatſoever the Father doth, that doth the Son likewiſe,</hi> Joh. 5.19. And as man, is one with him in reſpect of their agreement as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the thing willed; <hi>Not as I will, but as thou will,</hi> Mat. 26.39. is the example and pattern of Beleevers Union with Chriſt, and in him one with other, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.11. <hi>That they may be one as we are one,</hi> and verſe 21. <hi>that they may all be one, as thou Father artin me, and I in thee, that they alſo may be one in us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of this myſtical Union between Chriſt, and beleevers, we read often in the Scripture, ſometime in proper and plain termes, <hi>That they may be one, as we are,</hi> Joh. 17.11. <hi>He that is joyned to the Lord is one Spirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.17.</p>
               <p>Sometimes in elegant and lively Metaphors, firſt of a Vine and branches, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.1, 2. <hi>I am the true Vine, and my Father is the Husbandman, Every branch, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 Of Implantation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.5. <hi>For if we have been planted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the likeneſſe of his death, we ſhall be alſo in the likeneſſe of his reſurrection.</hi> Chriſt here is repreſented under the ſimilitude of a Plant, for as a Plant that is ſet into the earth, ſeemeth to lye dead, and is unmoveable for a time, but after ſprings up and flouriſheth, ſo as other Plants ſprout forth, grow up, and are nouriſhed thereby, as we ſee in Ivie and Miſſelto: So Chriſts body lay dead in the grave for a while, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſprung up and re-flouriſhed in his Reſurrection, as that Plant of renown, with whom, we being planted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, grow up by his grace.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Of Ingrafting, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.17, 19, 23, 24. where Chriſt is tacitly compared unto the Stock, the beleever unto the Graft, or Cyon; for notwithſtanding <hi>Abraham</hi> be the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental root, good Olive tree, and ſtock there expreſly ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, in whom, his ſeed, that is all beleevers (for he is

               <p n="4">4 Of incorporation into one myſtical body, whereof Chriſt is the Head, Beleevers are the Members, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12, 13.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Of a Spiritual conjugal eſtate, wherein Chriſt is the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, Beleevers are his Spouſe, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.32.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Of a Building, wherein Chriſt is compared to the foundation, or corner Stone; Beleevers to a Houſe, or living Stones, built or layed thereupon, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.25. and 16.18. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4, 5.</p>
               <p>Union is the conjunction of the Perſon of Chriſt,<note place="margin">What Union is.</note> and the Perſon of the Beleever, into one third being; whence ariſeth an everlaſting relation, and anſwerable communion of Head and Members, between Chriſt and the Beleever for ever.</p>
               <p>As in Marriage (the type of this Union) the conſent of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and Parties, is the efficient cauſe; So here, the will of God the Father, the will of Chriſt, and the voluntary conſent of the Beleever, cauſed by the operation of the Spirit, are the efficient cauſe of this Marriage.</p>
               <p>God the Father from all eternity, hath willed the Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Marriage of his Son, unto the Elect.</p>
               <p>The will of Chriſt is conformable unto the will of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.19, 20.</p>
               <p>The Elect by beleeving give their conſent to be married un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The Miniſters of the Goſpel are the inſtrumentall cauſe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.29.2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2.</p>
               <p>The matter of this union is the whole perſon of Chriſt, on the one part, and the whole perſon of the Beleever on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:118295:144"/>part. Mark it diligently, that the whole perſon of Chriſt, and the whole perſon of the Beleever, are united together.</p>
               <p>The whole Perſon of Chriſt is united unto the Beleever, elſe we were not united unto Chriſt; for neither the Divine, nor Human nature conſidered apart, is Chriſt; Chriſt is God-man in one perſon, Chriſt is not our Head as God alone, nor as Man alone, but as God-man.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Deitas eſt fons, unde fluunt omnia bona, vita, &amp; ſalus. Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitas eſt caualis, per quem ad nos derivantur omnia haec bona.</note> It would elſe follow that our union would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable; the Humanity profits nothing without the Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; it is the Spirit that quick neth, the fleſh profiteth nothing, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.63. the Divinity wil profit nothing without the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.53. <hi>Then ſayed Jeſus unto them, Verily, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, I ſay unto you, except yee eat the fleſh of the Sonne of Man, and drink his blood, yee have no life in you.</hi> The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity is the fountaine from which all good things flow, the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity is the chanel by which all good things are derived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Elect.</p>
               <p>As the whole Perſon of Chriſt is united unto the Beleever, ſo the whole perſon of the Beleever is united unto Chriſt; we are not only one with Chriſt in reſpect of our Souls, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. but we are alſo one with Chriſt in reſpect of our bodies; <hi>For we are members of his Body, of his fleſh, and of his bones,</hi> Eph. 5.30. <hi>One fleſh;</hi> If man and wife by vertue of their Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age union (which is but the Type) become one fleſh, then Chriſt and the Beleever, by vertue of their Spiritual union, (which is the Antitype) muſt needs be one fleſh, verſ. 31. our perſon being in the ſame Myſtical body with his perſon, our fleſh muſt needs be in the ſame Myſtical body with his fleſh, where yet we muſt obſerve, that this conjunction of our fleſh with the fleſh of Chriſt, is not Corporal, but Spiritual; and to be underſtood of our fleſh, not ſimply, but ſanctified.</p>
               <p>As our fleſh hath ſpiritual Communion with the fleſh of Chriſt in the Sacrament; ſo our fleſh hath union with the fleſh of Chriſt in regeneration.</p>
               <p>Such as is our Communion, ſuch is our Union; but our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mun on is from the whole perſon of Chriſt, to the whole per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Beleever; therefore our union is between the whole perſon of Chriſt, and the whole perſon of the Beleever.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="287" facs="tcp:118295:144"/>Neither is our Soul alone joyned with the Soul of Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,<note place="margin">Neque ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma noſtra ſola, cum ſola Chriſti anima; ne<expan>

                  </note> nor is our fleſh alone joyned with the fleſh of Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but the whole perſon of every Beleever, is joyned with the whole perſon of Chriſt.

See <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus</hi> alſo to the ſame purpoſe; the whole perſon of every Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever, Soul and Body, is truly conjoyned with the whole perſon of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The form of this union is the actual conjoyning of the perſon of Chriſt, and the perſon of the Beleever, in ſome third being,<note place="margin">Of the form of Union.</note> by the bands on either part.</p>
               <p>For the better underſtanding the form of this union, three things are to be attended. 1. That third being, or thing, wherein Chriſt and the Beleever are united. 2. The bands on Chriſts part, and on the Beleevers, by which they are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. 3. The manner of this union.</p>
               <p>Concerning the third being, or thing (which for readineſſe ſake in this diſcourſe may be called a <hi>tertium</hi>) wherein Chriſt and a Beleever are united; (it being premiſed and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, that all union is of two ones, or more, into a third one, ariſing out of, and diſtinguiſhed from both) we are carefully to obſerve, that the Scripture mentions divers <hi>Tertiums,</hi> or third ones (whence alſo ſo many kinds of union may not unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably be collected) wherein Chriſt and the Beleever are united, foure whereof are theſe.</p>
               <p>The firſt <hi>Tertium,</hi> or third being, wherein Chriſt and the Beleever are united, is, <hi>Sameneſs</hi> of ſpirit; but he that is joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Lord is one ſpirit; the created grace which is in the Beleever, is the ſame in kinde with the created grace that is in the Manhood of Chriſt; <hi>Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, becauſe he hath given us of his Spirit,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.13. <hi>Now, if any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt he is none of his,</hi> Rom. 8.9. <hi>Partakers of the divine nature,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="288" facs="tcp:118295:145"/>The ſecond is, <hi>One Myſticall body; For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body being many, are one body, ſo is Chriſt; For by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.12, 13.</p>
               <p>The third is, the <hi>Spiritual Marriage eſtate,</hi> Eph. 5.32. <hi>This is a great Myſterie, but I ſpeake concerning Christ and the Church; For thy Maker is thy Husband (the Lord of Hosts is his name) and the Redeemer, the holy one of Iſrael, the God of the whole earth ſhal he be called,</hi> Iſa. 54.5. <hi>Thou ſhalt no more be termed forſaken, neither ſhall thy Land any more be termed deſolate; but thou ſhalt bee called</hi> Hephzi-bah, <hi>and thy Land</hi> Beulah, <hi>for the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth in thee, and thy Land ſhall be married,</hi> Iſa. 62.4.</p>
               <p>The fourth is, the <hi>ſtate of glory, And the glory which thou gaveſt me I have given them, that they may be one even as we are one, I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one, and that the world may know that thou haſt ſent me,</hi> Joh. 17.22, 23.</p>

               <p>If <hi>Sameneſs</hi> of ſpirit be the third being, then God in Chriſt giving his Spirit in a word of grace on the one part; and the Soul receiving paſsively that Spirit of grace (as an empty veſſel receiveth oyl) on the other part, are the bands of union.</p>
               <p>When the body myſticall is looked at, as that third being, then Chriſt in the gift of the grace of faith, giving himſelfe as our God actually, is the band on his part; and either the Souls receiving of Chriſt actually, in its paſſive receipt of faith, or

               <p>Laſtly, If we conſider this union, in the third being of a <hi>ſtate of glory,</hi> Chriſt giving glory is the band on his part; our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, whether paſſively or actively, may reſpectively bee looked at, as the band on our part.</p>
               <p>The juſt obſervation of theſe ſeveral kinds of Union may haply be of uſe to reconcile that tenet, which affirmeth Union to be by the habit of faith, with that tenet (ordinarily held forth in the writing of the Orthodox) affirming Union to be by the Spirit, and Faith, underſtanding by faith the act of faith.</p>
               <p>The firſt kinde of union is by the Habit, not by the Act; the ſecond may be looked at, as being by both, either Habit, or Act; the third is by the Act, not by the Habit. That propoſition of frequent uſe among Divines, <hi>ſc.</hi> Union is by the Spirit, and faith; that is, by the Spirit on Chriſts part, and Faith on our part,<note place="margin">

               <p>Touching the manner of this Union wherein Chriſt and the Beleever are united, we may not unprofitably conſider it, Firſt negatively, Secondly poſitively; Negatively, it is not eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential, ſuch as is the union of the three Perſons in one eſſence in God. Nor perſonal, ſuch as is the union of the Divine and Human nature, in one (and that an increated) perſon in Chriſt. Not natural; whether eſſential, as is the union of the form with the matter; or by Local contact, <hi>i. e.</hi> natural touching one of another, as water is united to the veſſel; or by mixture, as water is united to Hony; or by the coupling together of a

               <p>Secondly, Poſitively, 'tis a Spiritual, and a Myſtical union, therefore the whole into which theſe Members are united, is called a Myſtical body.</p>
               <p>This Spiritual union, in reſpect of the verity thereof, is real; in reſpect of the things united, 'tis ſubſtantial; in reſpect of its way, or manner, 'tis ſupernatural, and ſecret; in reſpect of the neerneſſe of it, 'tis cloſe, and intimate.</p>
               <p>'Tis a true, not an imaginary union; 'tis ſayed to be real, or ſubſtantial, in reſpect of the things that are united, viz. the ſubſtance of Chriſt, and the ſubſtance of the Beleever. In this union we doe not receive the ſpecies, or likeneſſe of Chriſt, as the underſtanding receiveth the ſpecies of the Object, but not the Object it ſelfe; not are we thereby made partakers of the Spirit of Chriſt alone, and not of himſelfe; but we are made partakers of both, the very perſon of Chriſt, and the perſon of the Beleever, are (as we ſaw before) united together, as the perſon of the Husband, and the perſon of the Wife (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Local diſtance) are united together.</p>
               <p>From the neerneſſe of the union between Chriſt, and his Members, the body Myſtical is called by the name of Chriſt. Chriſt is conſidered either Perſonally in himſelfe, or Collective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, together with the Church, which is his Body; ſo both Head and Members are required to make one Chriſt; that is, Chriſt not Perſonal, but Myſtical, in which latter ſenſe the Scripture calleth the Head and Body taken together, by the name of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. <hi>For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body being many, are one body, ſo is Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 3.16. <hi>And to thy ſeed, which is Chriſt;</hi> that is, all his Myſtical body. Hence the ſufferings of <hi>Paul,</hi> and of other Beleevers (which we muſt yet remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber were edificatory, not ſatisfactory, in way of edification, not in way of ſatisfaction) are called the ſufferings of Chriſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.24.</p>

                  <pb n="291" facs="tcp:118295:146"/>The end of union is an everlaſting and ſatisfactory commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,<note place="margin">

               <p>A being or eſſence is the thing it ſelfe; Oneneſs is an affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on immediatly flowing from the meer being of a thing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is individed in it ſelfe, and divided from all other beings, or things.</p>
               <p>Union is the conjunction of two ones or more into a third being; for example ſake,<note place="margin">Ens, unum, unio.</note> take a man conſiſting of Body and Soul, the Soul firſt hath a being, then this ſingular being, and not another; then it is united unto the body in a third being, namely, the perſon of a man; the like is true of the body.</p>
               <p>In Vocation we receive our being, in Union is the manner of our being.</p>
               <p>In Vocation we are made Beleevers, in Union is conſidered the order between Chriſt and Beleevers.</p>
               <p>In Vocation is the foundation of our union, in Union is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation built upon that foundation.<note place="margin">Inter illa quae conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuntur, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſendi conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentiam, illud eſt prius, quod habet rationem ſubjecti. <hi>Alſted.

               <p>In Vocation is the ſpirit of grace infuſed; in Union this infuſed ſpirit is made an in-dwelling ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Without Union there can be no Communion. This neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily pre-ſuppoſeth, that things cannot act one upon another, that doe not reach one the other; they cannot give and take one from another, that doe not ſome way meet together; yet here we muſt know, that the contact, or mutual touch of things, is not alwayes Local, when their ſubſtances or Bodies doe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly touch one another, but often-times vertual only; when (notwithſtanding they doe not immediately touch one the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet) they reach one the other in their efficacy. Inſtances whereof we have many in Natural cauſes, as the Loadſtone and Iron ſeparated in place, yet act one upon another; that by
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:118295:147"/>attracting, this by following. In Political matters, perſons though diſtant in place one from another, yet exerciſe civil communion in the affairs of this life. In Spiritual things, as namely, in the Sacrament, the Body and Blood of Chriſt is united to the Elements vertually, that is by vertue of Divine inſtitution, and promiſe, not Locally; (to deny that, were to deny the Sacrament to be a Sacrament, to ſay the laſt were to affirm Ubiquity, whether Tranſubſtantiation with the Papiſts, or Conſubſtantiation with the <hi>Lutherans;</hi>) So here the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Chriſt, who in reſpect of his Body is in Heaven, and the perſons of his Militant members, who in reſpect both of Souls and Bodies are upon the earth, are united to, and doe Spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touch one another; <hi>I am the Vine, yee are the Branches, he that abideth in me, and I in him, the ſame bringeth forth much fruit; for without me yee can doe nothing, Joh.</hi> 15.5.</p>
               <p>For the better diſcerning the order of the dependence of Communion upon Union,<note place="margin">The order of the depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion upon Union.</note> from whence it floweth; we may conſider in Union (as is alſo to be done in other relations) theſe foure particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The ſubject of the Relation, the perſon of Chriſt, and the perſon of the Beleever.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The foundation of it, on Chriſts part, the Divine inſtitution abſolutely conſidered; on our part, faith conſidered only as an infuſed ſaving quality in the Soul.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, A mutual reference, on Chriſts part ſuperadding a reſpect to Divine inſtitution, whereby according to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of God, he looks at the Beleever as his Member; ſuperadding alſo on the Beleevers part a reſpect unto faith, whereby faith which in it ſelfe is but a quality, hath now ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to it an order to its object; whence it looks at Chriſt as its head.<note place="margin">In relatis ſpectanda Subjectum, Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, Mutuus ordo Efficacia.</note> This mutual order between Chriſt and the Beleever, is the relation it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The efficacie of the relation.</p>
               <p>The efficacie of a Relation ſpringeth from its foundation; the foundation then of this being firſtly the abſolute grace of God in election, and thence flowing downe in the Promiſe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the merit of Chriſt, by the effectual operation of the
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:118295:147"/>Spirit: Needs muſt the River of life be full, ever-flowing,<note place="margin">Tametſi re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latis eſt ens debilis entita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, tamen eſt magnae effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciae.</note> and quickning, that ariſeth from, and is mantained by ſuch fountains; the influence of the Occan into water-ſprings, of the Sun and Heaven into inferior bodies, is not to be compared thereunto. Next to the increated Communion of the Trinity in the Divine Eſſence, and the communicated influence from the Divine nature to the Man-hood, is the influence of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, unto the members of his myſtical body. <hi>And thou ſhalt make them drink of the river of thy pleaſures, for with thee is the fountain of Life. In thy light we ſhall ſee light,</hi> Pſal. 36.8, 9.</p>

               <p>To juſtifie declaratively, is when a perſon accuſed, or, both accuſed and convicted, as an offender, is juſtly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted by the judicial declaration of his Legal innocency, and freedome from guilt and puniſhment.</p>
               <p>To juſtifie in this place, is not by way of infuſion, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſanctifie, that is, of a perſon unclean, unholy, and unjuſt, to make him formally, and inherently pure, holy, juſt, by working in him the inherent qualities of purity, ſanctity, and righteouſneſſe; but judicially to abſolve a guilty ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner at the Tribunal of Gods Juſtice from guilt and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to declare him righteous. Juſtification in this place doth not ſignifie a change of our nature, but a change of our ſtate, <hi>i. e.</hi> of our ſpiritual condition, in order to the curſe and promiſe; ſo as the perſon, which was under the Law before, is now not under the Law, but under grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14.</p>
               <p>It is a Court-phraſe, taken not Phyſically, but Judicially, for a Judicial, not a Phyſical act; it ſignifieth a relative Juſtification, of accounting a man juſt, not an habitual Juſtification, of making a man juſt; thus <hi>Barrabas</hi> a Thief, is acquitted judicially, whence followed a Legal, not a Phyſical change of <hi>Barrabas.</hi>

In which laſt places, and the like, <hi>Pemble</hi> (after others) obſerveth that to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, is in judicial proceeding to abſolve a party from fault, and blame, whether it be rightly, or wrongfully, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.52. <hi>Luke</hi> 16.15.

               <p>Infuſed righteouſneſſe (which is ſanctification) is
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:118295:150"/>diſtinguiſhed from Juſtification. Though they are inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, yet they are diſtinguiſhed; as light and heat, in the Sun, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. &amp; 6.11. The ſubject of our Juſtification is Chriſt, the ſubject of Sanctification is the Beleever. Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is onely imputative, Sanctification is inherent. Juſtification makes a relative change, Sanctification an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Phyſical change. Juſtification is an individuall act, all at once; Sanctification is gradual, by degrees. Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is perfect in this life, Sanctification is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
               <p>It is plain that the Apoſtle by Juſtification intends re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins, therefore, not inherent righteouſneſſe, <hi>We are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Rom. 3.23, 24. which redemption, is remiſſion of ſins, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.14.

(or at leaſt that which is as a part) is put for the whole, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the cauſe; ſo alſo is there a part put for the whole, in
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:118295:153"/>reſpect of the effect of that cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Juſtification, which is but a part of the good of Redemption, is put for the whole good thereof.

                  <hi>Que.

Imputation is either Legal, imputing unto us that which we have done, ſo the word is uſed <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.4. or Evangelical, imputing unto us that which another hath done; thus to impute, is for God in his act of juſtifying a ſinner, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt (which is not ours formally, not by debt) to be ours by Grace, as verily and really as if it were wrought by us; and in this ſenſe the word is uſed ten times, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. v. 3.5, 6.8, 9, 10, 11.22, 23, 24.</p>
               <p>The juſtification of a Beleever is either by righteouſneſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent, or imputed; but not by righteouſneſſe inherent, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by righteouſneſſe imputed. The righteouſneſſe whereby man is juſtified before God, is perfect; but the inherent righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of a Beleever is not perfect. It were deſtructive to the merit, and righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, to ſay, we were juſtified by a righteouſneſſe inherent in us; We are made righteous by the obedience of Chriſt, as we are made unrighteous by the diſobedience of <hi>Adam.</hi> But this is by imputation; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>All juſtification of the ungodly (that is, ſuch as are under the guilt and power of their-ſins) is by imputed righteouſneſs; but the Juſtification of a Beleever,<note place="margin">Juſtificat impios in ſenſu diviſo, non in ſenſu compoſito. <hi>Trelcat. ſen.</hi> Juſtificat impios antecedenter, non conſequenter. <hi>Paraeus</hi> in Rom. <hi>4.5.</hi>
                  </note> is the Juſtification of the ungodly, <hi>Rom</hi> 4.5. therefore. God juſtifieth the ungodly, <hi>viz.</hi> objectively, not ſubjectively; that is, ſuch who were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly until they were juſtified, but doe not remain ungodly being juſtified.</p>
               <p>That Juſtification which is by the righteouſneſſe of another, is by way of imputation; but the juſtification of a Beleever is by the righteouſneſſe of another; that is, ſuch, the matter whereof is the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt; as we ſaw largely in the Material cauſe of our Juſtification. <hi>Paul</hi> calleth Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication his righteouſneſſe, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. for though we are made partakers of it, by a power which is without us, yet it is inherent in us, as in its proper ſubject; and in that notion is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:118295:154"/>to the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, whereby we are juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; whereof he is not only the worker, but which alſo is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in him, as its proper ſubject; therefore the juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Beleever is by way of imputation.</p>
               <p>No ſinner, remaining a ſinner when he is juſtified, can be juſtified otherwiſe than by imputed righteouſneſſe; but all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers though juſtified, yet remain ſinners while they live in this world, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.8. therefore all Beleevers are juſtified by an imputed righteouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>The final cauſe is the manifeſtation of the glory of grace,<note place="margin">The finall cauſe.</note> in a way of Mercy, tempered with Juſtice; in a way of Mercy, in that he juſtifieth the ungodly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. and that freely, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. tempered with Juſtice, in that he juſtifieth not without Chriſts full ſatisfaction unto the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.26.</p>
               <p>The inſtrumental cauſe, or inſtrument of our Juſtification,<note place="margin">The inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental cauſe, or inſtrument.</note>(for faith here is but a meer inſtrument) is faith; the fuller underſtanding of this Propoſition followeth in the next parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
               <p>Here obſerve the intent, and conſent of ſuch Scriptures, as ſpeak diverſly of the cauſe of Juſtification; we are ſayed to bee juſtified by grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. <hi>i. e.</hi> as the Efficient cauſe; by his Blood, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.9. <hi>i. e.</hi> as the Meritorious cauſe; by his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. <hi>i. e.</hi> as the Material cauſe; by imputation of his obedience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.6. <hi>i.e.</hi> as the Formal cauſe; by faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. <hi>i. e.</hi> as the inſtrument.</p>
               <p>This Propoſition, <hi>We are juſtified by faith,</hi> is figurative,<note place="margin">How Faith juſtifieth.</note> 
                  <hi>i.e.</hi> Metonymical, whereby that which belongs to the principal cauſe, is attributed to the inſtrumental cauſe. Faith juſtifieth not for its own worth, but for the worth of the object which it apprehends; Faith doth not juſtifie as an act of ours, but all the vertue thereof proceedeth from its object; the vertue that healed the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> proceeded from the object, <hi>viz.</hi> the brazen Serpent they looked upon, not from the looking upon the Brazen Serpent, and the vertue that healed the Woman, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.46.48.50. proceeded out of Chriſt who was touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not out of the Womans touch; we are declared righteous upon our beleeving. Faith in the matter of our Juſtification, is the inſtrument apprehending, and applying that which doth
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:118295:155"/>juſtifie; the proper act of Faith is, to receive the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of another; we are juſtified by faith correlatively, that is, we are juſtified by that which is the correlate of faith, namely, the obedience of Chriſt; the meaning is, it is the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of Chriſt, not Faith that juſtifieth; that which is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, not that which apprehendeth. Faith alone juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that is, faith (as it juſtifieth) is alone; but juſtifying faith is not alone, that is, faith as it juſtifieth, is without workes, but the faith that juſtifieth is a working faith.</p>
               <p>We are juſtified by faith alone.</p>

               <p>Firſt, We need the righteouſneſſe of another, and the righteouſneſſe of this other is ſufficient, the leaſt ſinner needs no leſſe, the greateſt ſinner needs no more; the leaſt ſinner cannot be ſaved without it, the greateſt ſinner needs no more to be ſaved: God cannot ſave any Infant without the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt is fully able to ſave all beleevers. See the <hi>Sinfulneſs of Sin,</hi> that nothing but the righteouſneſſe of him who is God, could expiate it; See the <hi>Righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, which taketh away all ſin.</hi> Faith acknowledgeth the leaſt ſin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable without it, the greateſt pardonable by it; Were we onely guilty of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, we could not be ſaved without it, Were we guilty of all the ſins of the Elect, we might be ſaved by it.</p>
               <p>To think any ſin little is a great ſin, tis a greater to think that <hi>Chriſts righteouſnes</hi> is not above all ſin, our diſobedience
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:118295:157"/>is but the diſobedience of man, but the obedience of Chriſt, is the obedence of him, who is both God and man; the diſobedience of man is infinit only improperly, in reſpect of the object, the obedience of Chriſt is infinite properly, in reſpect of the ſubject, that which is infinit hath no limits, but the pleaſure of the diſpoſer. <hi>Davids</hi> childe needed the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt for its juſtification, and <hi>Manaſſeth</hi> needed no more. To think any ſin little, is no little ſin, tis to excuſe ſin, to accuſe juſtice in ſentencing our ſin in <hi>Adam,</hi> or original ſin, with death, to leſſen, nay ſo far to fruſtrate the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt. The Phariſee puts confidence in his not having done ſo ill, yea in his having done better than other men, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.11. That he had ſo done was good, but that he put confidence in it, was bad. If thy hope be more in thy little ſins then in Chriſts great mercy, Woe be unto thee; had there been but one man to have been redeemed, Chriſt muſt have dyed; and Chriſts death was ſufficient to have redeemed all men: Tis a ſin for the leaſt ſinner, not to deſpair of righteouſneſſe in reſpect of himſelf, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.7.10. Tis a ſin for the greateſt ſinner to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair concerning the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt; He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth not, be he never ſo righteous, ſhall be damned, He that beleeveth, hath he been never ſo unrighteous, ſhall be ſaved.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The beleever acknowledging his righteouſneſſe to be the righteouſneſſe of another, to be merited by another acknowledgeth it to be free, it coſt Chriſt to the full, but it coſt us nothing, <hi>being juſtified freely by his grace,</hi> Rom. 3.24.</p>
               <p>Juſtification is called the gift of righteouſneſſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.11. <hi>the free gift, the gift of grace,</hi> verſ 15, <hi>Grace</hi> in this verſe, noting the love of God it ſelf; the gift by grace, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, as an effect of that love. God will either not juſtifie at all, or juſtifie for nothing; tis the glory of grace to be free, and mans prirce to come without mony. The experience of this truth is compared to buying, becauſe the ſinner parts as hardly with his righteouſneſſe, as the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous man doth with his mony, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1. <hi>And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both,</hi> Luke 7.42.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="313" facs="tcp:118295:157"/>God will take nothing for our Juſtification; as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the whole, ſo to each part of grace not to be free. To attribute any thing to man in way of condignity, or congruity, were to leſſen the ſinfulneſſe of ſin, to exalt man, to betray Grace, and to take ſo much from Chriſt. This truth God ſtandeth much upon, as is notably to be ſeen in the manner of <hi>Naamans</hi> cure, a figure of the free recovery of a ſinner, both from the power, and guilt of ſin, hence the Prophet healeth him for nothing, and though urged, refuſeth, and that not without an oath, but he ſaid, <hi>As the Lord liveth, before whom I ſtand, I will receive none,</hi> and he being urged to take it, ſtill refuſeth, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 5.16. Where God forgiveth ſin, be forgiveth much; no ſin is in it ſelf little, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.47. <hi>Simon</hi> the Phariſee, who looked at ſin as a little thing, was not forgiven at all; where God forgiveth little, or much, he forgiveth all for nothing. That which is ſaid of the Lilly compared with <hi>Solomon, Conſider the Lillies of the field how they grow, they toyl not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do they ſpin, and yet I ſay unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of theſe,</hi> Matth. 6.28, 29. is moſt true of the Beleevers compared with the Lillies; The Garments of fine linnen, the righteouſneſs of the Saints, far exceed the glorious aray of the Lillies, yet they do not ſo much as ſpin for it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In the putting on of the Garments of Chriſts righteouſneſſe, there is a putting off of the filthy rags of our own righteouſneſſe. In this ſenſe Chriſt cloaths only the naked, and he that is cloathed ſavingly owneth his own nakedneſſe, and the unrighteouſneſſe of his own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>Our unrighteouſneſſe ſtrikes againſt the Law, but our righteouſneſſe takes away grace; that is againſt God, this againſt God and Chriſt; that makes us need the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, this keeps us incurable by it; that is againſt the command, this is againſt the promiſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.14. that makes the Law weak, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3: this ſubmits not unto the ſtrength of the Goſpel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver accounts much of the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:118295:158"/>and loatheth his own, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8. he abhorreth himſelf, for his own high account of his own righteouſneſs, onr own righteouſneſs is called our ſhame, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.15. Chriſts righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe is our glory, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.25. <hi>In the Lord ſhall the ſeed of Iſrael be juſtified, and ſhall glory.</hi> The beleever how great a ſinner ſoever formerly, though a Murtherer, Adulterer, Lyar, &amp;c. by this one act of beleeving Jeſus Chriſt and his righteouſneſſe, yeeldeth more obedience unto God, than ever he committed diſobedience, honoureth God more, than ever he hath hitherto diſhonoured him, pleaſeth God better than if he had ever continued in innocency, and never ſinned. God makes much account of the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of faith, becauſe faith makes much account of the grace of God. It is a name of honour unto Chriſt to be called, <hi>Our Righteouſneſſe, Jer.</hi> 23 6. and a name of honour to the people of God, that according to their duty, they are known to acknowledge Chriſt according to this name. And this is the name wherewith He ſhall be called, <hi>The Lord our Righteouſneſſe, Jer.</hi> 33.16.</p>

               <p>Juſtification conſidered in the abſtract, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſimply, and in it ſelf (in which ſenſe it ſignifieth remiſſion of ſins, and righteouſneſſe to acceptation, prepared though not yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon the Elect) hath before faith a being not onely in the purpoſe of God, but alſo in the Covenant between the Father, and the Mediator, and in the purchaſe of Chriſt; This truth held forth in the Goſpel makes the object of faith, and thus the object is before the act.</p>
               <p>Or thus, diſtinguiſh between Juſtification actually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, and actually applied.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="315" facs="tcp:118295:158"/>Juſtification was eminentially procured before faith,<note place="margin">Docet A mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Chriſtum ſatisfactione ſua nactum eſſe jus pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendorum non peccatorum remiſſionem. <hi>Twiſſ.</hi> de permiſſ. l. <hi>2.</hi> er <hi>4</hi> p. <hi>84.</hi>
                  </note> in reſpect of thoſe who beleeved before Chriſt dyed (when it was as entire to God to juſtifie for the merit ſake of Chriſt to dye, as it is now for the merit ſake of Chriſt dead) it is actually procured for thoſe who beleeve after the death of Chriſt, though it be not actually applied before faith.</p>
               <p>This actuall procuring of Juſtification (as did alſo the eminential procuring of it before Chriſt) giveth a being to Juſtification as conſidered in it ſelf, and conſtitutes the object of juſtifying faith. Juſtification is compared to a garment, our being juſtified to the putting on of that garment, the garment is made before it be put on. Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is compared to a pardon, our being juſtified unto the Delinquents being pardoned, the pardon is procured before the Delinquent is pardoned.</p>
               <p>Theſe then are both truths; Firſt, Juſtification hath a being before the Elect do beleeve. Secondly, That the Elect are not juſtified before they do beleeve.</p>
               <p>Juſtification is the object, faith is the act, the object is before the act; our being actually juſtified is an effect, faith is the inſtrumental cauſe, the cauſe is before the effect.</p>
               <p>That Juſtification is actually and abſolutely procured for the Elect before faith, and ſhall infallibly be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to them all in time, ſeemeth to reach the ſcope in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the godly Learned, whoſe ſpirits have more particularly laboured to hold forth the full truth in this precious part of the ſoul-reconciling, and ſoul-ſupporting myſtery of the Goſpèl. To ſay that we are juſtified by vertue of a ſingular promiſe in the Court of Conſcience, and in our own perſons (in which ſenſe the Scripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſaith that we are juſtified by faith) is not (that I know) affirmed by any.</p>
               <p>The grounds of this Diſtinction are thus evidenced.</p>
               <p>Juſtification was in Gods Decree, before faith, before ſin, yea from all Eternity, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8. whom God hath ſet forth, that is fore-ordained, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25.</p>
               <p>The Juſtification of the Elect, is abſolutely and actually procured for them by Chriſts ſatisfaction before faith, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.14. The hand-writing of Ordinances cannot be limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:118295:159"/>to the Ceremonial Law onely, becauſe it had reſpect unto the Gentiles then living, to whom the Ceremonial Law belonged not.</p>
               <p>God hath declared his acceptation of this ſatisfaction of Chriſt, whereby he hath actually procured Juſtification for the Elect before faith.</p>
               <p>It is no ſmall part of the Miniſtry of Reconciliation, that God imputed unto Chriſt the ſins of the world of the Elect before they did beleeve, and will not impute them unto the Elect, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18, 19. this great Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-truth is of ſpecial uſe to beget juſtifying faith in the heart of a ſinner, the ſame Apoſtle confirms Beleevers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their ſalvation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. from this argument, namely that their reconciliation was wrought for them, when they were enemies, that is, unbeleevers.</p>
               <p>Here then is a twofold Reconciliation mentioned, one at the death of Chriſt, before <hi>Paul,</hi> or the <hi>Romans</hi> (ſome of them at leaſt) here ſpoken to were beleevers: The other at our Converſion.</p>
               <p>The firſt Reconciliation though it was vertually wrought before, by the Lamb ſlain (in Gods appointment, &amp; acceptance, together with his own conſent) from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.8. yet, it was not actually wrought untill the death Chriſt; for this ſatisfaction ſake, God imputes not ſin unto the Redeemed (for he cannot impute ſin to Chriſt, and the Elect both) yea he accepteth us in the Beloved, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.6. Loving the perſons of the Elect, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.28. though hating theirs ſins, and alſo their ſtate under the curſe of the Law, <hi>Ro.</hi> 6.14 Ch. 7.6. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is wrought at our Converſion, when the enmity of nature is ſlain by the infuſion of grace, our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are juſtified in themſelves, and our ſtate changed by faith in Chriſt Jeſus. This place then ſeemeth not to be underſtood as that <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. God juſtifieth the ungodly, <hi>viz.</hi> objectively, that is, ſuch who were ungodly till they were juſtified, not ſubjectively, that is, ſuch as remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly when they are juſtified. The Text ſaith not, he recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileth enemies according to the ſenſe of thoſe words in the former place <hi>[He juſtifieth the ungodly]</hi> But, <hi>If when we were
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:118295:159"/>enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son,</hi> (mark, the time of this Reconciliation was the time of the death of his Son, not the time of our Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) <hi>much more being reconciled, we ſhall be ſaved by his life;</hi> that is, If while we were enemies in reſpect of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and ſtate, we were reconciled in our head, <hi>i. e.</hi> our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation was actually purchaſed by, and acknowledged at the death of his Son; how much more being reconciled in our ſelves by the ſlaying of the enmity of nature, through the infuſion of grace, and the changing of our eſtate in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of our perſons and actions through faith in Chriſt, ſhall we be ſaved by his life? he that hath done the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with greateſt difficulty, he will do the leſſe; having o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome and triumphed over all difficulty paſt, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, being without all difficulty in reſpect of what is to come.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Juſtification is actually procured, and hath its being in Gods decree, and in our Surety, before we doe beleeve: Faith is no inſtrument or motive of Gods abſolute decree to juſtifie; nor is it any inſtrument of Chriſts ſatisfactory and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious obedience, either active or paſſive; or of Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:118295:162"/>of that ſatisfaction, nor of the imputing of his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unto the beleever, but the effect thereof.</p>
               <p>The actual declaration, in the Court of Conſcience, of the Beleever to be righteous is by faith, not for faith; by faith, as a band, means, or inſtrument receiving; not for faith, as a cauſe of that which is received. The nature of faith is to receive ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, and accept Free grace, to ſeal to the truth of Free grace. Laſtly, this grace, whoſe nature is to apprehend and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply Free grace, is the effect of Free grace; ſurely it ariſeth from the miſt of remaining legalneſſe, that our being juſtified in ſuch a way (whoſe very nature is to acknowledge the freeneſs of our juſtification) ſhould occaſion us to think Juſtification in that reſpect not to be free; Faith and Free Grace agree, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is of faith that it might be by grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16.</p>
               <p>Many Myſteries of the wiſdome of God ſhine forth in the doctrin of Juſtification.<note place="margin">Many depths of the wiſdom of God to be obſerved in the doctrin of juſtification.</note> Juſtification is univerſal; God forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth all ſin, ſins paſt, ſins preſent, and ſins to come; ſins paſt, formally; ſins to come, vertually; thoſe in themſelves, theſe in the ſubjects of them. Juſtification is an individual act, it admits not of degrees, it doth not receive more nor leſſe, though our ſenſibleneſſe of it be more or leſſe, yet our Juſtification is the ſame; perfect from its firſt inſtant, and not gradual. <hi>Paul</hi> a beleever was as juſtified as <hi>Paul</hi> in glory, becauſe the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of Chriſt, which is the matter of the juſtification of the Saints, is the ſame for ever; of like vertue, whether our faith be weaker or ſtronger; it is not ſuch a degree, but the truth of our faith that ſufficeth unto our being juſtified, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds received by a Palſie hand, is a thouſand pounds as wel as a thouſand received by a healthful hand. He that looked on the brazen Scrpent, though with a weaker ſight, was healed as throughly as he that looked upon it with a ſtrong ſight. A touch cureth the Woman as wel as a ful hold, <hi>Mar.</hi> 5.34.</p>
               <p>The ſenſe of our Juſtification is according to the degree and exerciſe of our faith, but the truth of our juſtification is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the truth of our faith; the juſtification of a ſinner is an undivided act, done altogether, not by parts; it doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive more or leſſe, if there be any there is all, and if not all, not any; either all, or none.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="323" facs="tcp:118295:162"/>Juſtification in reſpect of the price, and the acceptation of the perſons juſtified is equal; thus, The Perſon that ſuffered for all is one and the ſame; the ſufficiency of an infinite Perſon ſuffering was requiſite for the redemption of one, and in the ſuffering of an infinite Perſon, there was ſufficiency for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of all. The kinde of puniſhment ſuffered for all was the ſame, Gods acceptation thereof was the ſame, Chriſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſuffered the puniſhment due in kinde and degree to the greateſt ſinner; it coſt Chriſt no more to pardon <hi>Paul</hi> than <hi>Timothy,</hi> it coſt him as much to pardon <hi>Davids</hi> childe, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.23. as to pardon <hi>Manaſſeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The puniſhment for kinde and degree due unto the greateſt ſinner being ſuffered by an infinite perſon, it was as much as if all the elect had ſuffered; an infinite perſon containeth emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently all perſons; Chriſt therefore being in himſelf an infinite perſon, and being by Divine ordination a publick Perſon in his ſuffering, he was as many perſons as God willed him to ſtand for therein. Hence when the redemption mony was brought, the rich muſt not give more, the poor muſt not give leſſe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.15. in the Paſſeover, and in the Supper of the Lord, the portion of all is equal, the diſtribution of Manna was equal, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.18.</p>
               <p>A Beleever at the ſame time is a ſinner, in reſpect of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining principle of inherent diſobedience, and righteous, in reſpect of the imputed obedience of Chriſt; guilty of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation if looked at in himſelf, not guilty of Damnation if look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adam</hi> a Beleever, though a ſinner, was more juſt than <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> before the Fall; <hi>Adam</hi> before the Fall was without ſinne, and innocent, but not juſt, becauſe he had not fulfilled the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of the Law, <hi>Adam,</hi> a Beleever, though a ſinner, is yet juſt, becauſe by beleeving he hath fulfilled the righteouſneſſe of the Law. <hi>Adam</hi> innocent had no right unto eternallife, <hi>Adam</hi> a beleever (notwithſtanding ſin) hath right unto eternal life. The righteouſneſſe of one Beleever is more acceptable unto God, than the righteouſneſſe of all Mankind in the firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt was juſt inherently, but a ſinner imputatively; the Beleever is a ſinner inherently, but juſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putatively.
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:118295:163"/>
                  <hi>Mary</hi> under the Croſſe was more juſt imputative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than Chriſt, which was alſo true of every Beleever then li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, when Chriſt was under the actual imputation of ſin; the ſame righteouſneſſe is both anothers, and ours alſo; Anothers, that is Chriſts ſubjectively, yet ours, that is the Beleevers im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putatively. The righteouſneſſe of a Beleever in this life is both perfect, and imperfect; perfect in reſpect of Juſtification, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect in reſpect of Sanctification.<note place="margin">Annot on the Bible, in Numb. 23.</note> God looking on beleevers through Chriſt ſeeth no more ſin (ſafely underſtood) than he ſeeth in him; for they are made the righteouſneſſe of God in him by imputation.</p>
               <p>Hence followeth peace of Conſcience to all Beleevers,<note place="margin">Of the peace of Conſcience following upon juſtification by faith.</note> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all their unrighteouſneſſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. ſo farre as we have confidence in juſtifying grace, there remaineth no conſcience of condemning ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. No bitterer warre than between the Conſcience and the Curſe, no ſweeter peace than when Mercy and the Beleever meet together, when the Conſcience and the Promiſe kiſſe each other; that is a taſte of Hel, this of Heaven.</p>
               <p>Peace is that Goſpel-tranquillity which followeth upon the Souls certain relyance on Chriſt, concerning its freedome from the evil of the Curſe, and fruition of the good of the Promiſe, As Chriſt being the great ſinner imputatively, in the inſtant of his diſſolution, paſſed from a ſtate of wrath into a ſtate of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect peace; ſo doth the Beleever upon his juſtification by faith. If Chriſt hath peace, who was made our ſin, then need; muſt the Beleever have peace, who is made his righteouſneſſe; if <hi>Adams</hi> peace had been perfect in caſe of his fulfilling all righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, then the Beleevers peace is perfect, who hath ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled all righteouſneſſe in his Surety; the beleeving comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Goſpel, hath in Chriſt done, yea out-done the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing commanded in the Law.</p>
               <p>The peace of the Beleever is as perfect, as the peace of thoſe who are in glory, the righteouſneſſe of theſe being the ſame with theirs.</p>
               <p>See the grounds hereof in reſpect of God, and Chriſt.</p>
               <p>God himſelfe is the Author and Object of our peace, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is called, <hi>the peace of God,</hi> Phil. 4.7. <hi>peace with God,</hi>

               <p>The Merit of Chriſt (a fruit and effect whereof is juſtifying grace) is infinite, becauſe of the eminency of the perſon, being God-man; the Law violated was but a Creature, but he that was made ſubject to it is a Creator; the holineſſe of the ſubject exceeds the holineſſe of the Law; the tranſgreſſor of the Law was but a Man, the ſatisfier is God-man. See here the honour of the Law that had ſuch a ſubject, farre more than what could have redounded to it from the ſubjection of all Angels, and meer men. See the ſecurity of the Tranſgreſſor that hath ſuch a ſatisfier; our diſobedience is but the diſobedience of Men, his obedience is the obedience of him who is God; needs then muſt his righteouſneſſe exceed our unrighteouſneſſe, and in this reſpect wel may juſtifying grace compared with ſin, be called, abundance of grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.17.

               <p>In general whatſoever God hath revealed concerning himſelf, or the reaſonable, or unreaſonable creature, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in the object of the Beatifical Viſion.</p>
               <p>The primary object of the Beatifical Viſion is of coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall largeneſſe with, and co-extended to the object of faith. <hi>Paul</hi> makes the thing, or the object ſeen in the Life to come, to be the ſame with the object ſeen in this Life; but the manner of ſeeing is not the ſame. <hi>When I was a childe, I ſpake as a childe, I underſtood as a childe, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childiſh things. For now we ſee through a glaſſe darkly, but then face to face; now I know in part, but then ſhall I know, even as I alſo am known,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.11, 12. The thing underſtood by a man, and a child, darkly or cleerly, mediately or immediately, perfectly

The Eſſence is not without the Subſiſtence, nor the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence without the Eſſence.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Trinity of Perions; <hi>He that hath ſeen me, hath ſeen the Father,</hi> Joh. 14.9. not the Eſſence alone, nor the manner of the Subſiſtence alone; but the Eſſence with the manner of the Subſiſtence is a Perſon; So that he that ſeeth the Eſſence, ſeeth the Subſiſtences; our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion here is with the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13, 14.

               <p>The will of God repreſenting the creature, is that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

To ſay the creature is ſeen in God, and to ſay the creature is ſeen in the word, meaneth with Divines the ſame thing, becauſe works of knowledge (notwithſtanding they, as all other creatures, proceed equally from the Eſſence ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in three perſons, yet) are eſpecially appropriated unto the Son, in reſpect of the order of his ſubſiſtence. It is in the power of the Divine Eſſence to repreſent the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, becauſe this repreſentative power is a perfection: now all perfections are in God, becauſe God is an infinite Eſſence, and containeth eminently the perfection of the whole creature,<note place="margin">Orde dignita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis inter An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelorum cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitionem.

Could we ſee cleerly a building in the perfect conception of the Artificer, we ſhould ſee it in a more excellent manner than in the Edifice it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Yet we are to rembember, that the Divine Eſſence is an arbitrary,<note place="margin">Exemplum ideale. Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium.

               </p>
               <p>Concerning the manner of the Beatifical Viſion, not to ſay any thing that exceeds ſobriety, and yet to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that may help our underſtanding, only thus; As unto the act of the underſtanding, there is required the object, the ſpecies or ſimilitude of the object (or
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:118295:167"/>elſe either the eminent, or formal preſence thereof, which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth it) the faculty, and the exerciſe of the faculty; ſo unto the Beatifical Viſion, there is requiſite the concurrence of the object, the light of glory, the glorified underſtanding, and the everciſe of the underſtanding glorified.</p>
               <p>The primary object is the Divine eſſence it ſelf.</p>
               <p>In corporeal viſion, ſight is united to the object, by the help of the ſenſible ſpecies, <hi>i. e.</hi> the ſimilitudes, image, or likeneſſe of the object; in intellectual Viſion, the underſtanding is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the object, by intelectual ſpecies; but in the beatifical Viſion, the Divine eſſence it ſelf ſupplyeth the place of intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible ſpecies; for were there any other ſimilitude of the Divine eſſence, it muſt needs be a creature; but it is impoſſible for a thing created to repreſent that which is increated; a material ſpecies is unable to repreſent an immaterial object; much more is a created ſpecies unable to repreſent the increated object, there being more diſtance between the light of glory, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conceivable created ſimilitude, and the increated eſſence, than there is between a material and immaterial creature.</p>
               <p>Again, there is no uſe of any created ſpecies for the ſeeing of the Divine eſſence, by reaſon of its perfection, and immenſity; whence it can ſufficiently unite it ſelf, to the glorified under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
               <p>The Divine eſſence concurreth with the underſtanding, both as an univerſal Agent, and as the object of ſuch Viſion, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.23.</p>
               <p>The Beatifical object applieth it ſelf to the created under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, together with the underſtanding, cauſing this bleſſed Viſion. By its eminency it hurteth not, but perfecteth the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, as is implyed in its denomination of the Beatifical Viſion.</p>
               <p>The light of glory is a glorious ſupernatural influence, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring with, and inabling of the inherent principle, of the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied underſtanding, to ſee God. The light of glory may be ſo called, becauſe it accompanieth the ſtate of glory; it is a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted perfection.</p>
               <p>As aſſiſting grace is unto an act of new obedience, ſo is the light of glory unto the Beatifical Viſion; as that extraordinary
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:118295:168"/>aſſiſtance was unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> whereby from the top of <hi>Piſgah</hi> he was enabled at once, to take a true, full, and clear proſpect of the Land of <hi>Canaan, Deut.</hi> 3.27. and as that extraordinary aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance was unto <hi>Stephen,</hi> whereby whilſt he was yet on earth, (the Heavens being opened) he ſaw Jeſus Chriſt at the right hand of God; ſo is the ordinary aſſiſtance of the light of glory, in the life of glory, unto the bleſſed, in order to the Beatifical Viſion.</p>

               <p>The formal Bleſſedneſs of the glorified Soul, conſiſts in the clear viſion of this object, which ſucceedeth Faith; hereby we know God.

In perfect love thereof, which ſucceeds our charity; hereby we cloſe with, are like to, reſt, and acquieſce in God.</p>
               <p>By the Underſtanding, Will, and Affection, the Soul doth (as it were) enter into God, and God into the Soul; whence followeth (as it were) a mutual in-being of one in another, and an intimate vital union between God and the Soul. Either the viſion, fruition, and love of God, is Bleſſedneſſe, or there is no Bleſſedneſſe; God is not God, Heaven is not Heaven; the Creature, according to the beſt, namely, the Goſpel-diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God, is capable of no more, needs no more, can have no more; God in Chriſt doth no more for Man, man needs no more from God.</p>
               <p>Hereby the Soul enters into joy, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.21, 23. which is the reſt of the wil, in its utmoſt and perfecting end. In this Life joy enters into us, the Soul here being larger than its joy; in the Life to come, we are ſaid to enter into joy, as into that whereby our Soul is exceeded, and wherein (as it were) we are contained. If in the ſtate of faith the Soul is full of joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:118295:169"/>and full of glory; how much more ſhal it be full, and running over in the ſtate of fruition? Faith is the beſt Rhetorick, to walk ſo, as whether preſent, or abſent, we may be accepted of him, is the beſt Elocution; to admire, is ſhort of the cauſe; a holy aſtoniſhment anſwereth not the object.

               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 1 The Soul conſidered in it ſelf, is a ſubject capable of happineſs. It is a ſubject capable either of Bleſſedneſs, or Miſery; the Promiſe, or the Curſe; Heaven, or Hel. It was a good anſwer of him, that upon the propoſal of the Queſtion, <hi>What the Soul was?</hi> replied, <hi>I know not.</hi> Man ſince the Fall being leſſe than himſelf, underſtands not himſelf; nor wil he fully, til he be fully reſtored to himſelf, in glory; yet as a help to our appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, we may conceive of it, after this, or the like manner.</p>
               <p>The Soul is a Spiritual ſubſtance, created after the Image of God, indued with the faculties of Underſtanding, Wil, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and Affections, with a power of reflex acting upon it ſelf (whereby it knoweth that it knoweth) according to the Latitude of the whole revealed Wil, and Works of God; infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed into the body, as the form thereof, and (being ſeparated there-from) ſubſiſts by it ſelf, to be re-united thereunto, at the Reſurrection, to abide as the form thereof for ever. More briefly; The Soul of the Saints is a Spiritual, and Immortal
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:118295:170"/>ſubſtance, created after the Image of God, and renewed after the immortal Image of God in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The Soul is a Spirit, not a Body conſiſting of matter, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.39. It is a real and very being, as the body is, only of a higher kind; the Body is of the Earth, the Soul is immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from God. It ſhould not prejudice the being of the Soul, becauſe it is not viſible to our eyes; we may as wel queſtion the being of God himſelf, or of the Angels, who are inviſible; or our own ſelves to be Men, for from the Soul it principally is that we are Men, or Women. It is a ſubſtance not depending, in reſpect of its being, upon any other Fellow-creature, as acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents doe, whoſe being is by having their in-being in another Fellow-creature as their ſubject. Its ſubſiſtence exceeds that of the Body, the Soul can ſubſiſt without the Body, but the Body continueth not a Body without the Soul. Hence we read of ſeparated Souls, but not of ſeparated Bodies. The Soul is compared to a large veſſel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.22, 23. as high as Heaven, as deep as the earth, <hi>Prov.</hi> 25.3. more capacious than the world, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3.11. As the capacity of a veſſel may be learned by the quantity it is able to contain; ſo the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the word of command (which conſidered alone is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding broad, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.90.) Promiſe and Curſe, together with the works of God, helps us to conceive of the largeneſs of the Soul. <hi>Solomon</hi> in reſpect of his exceeding much under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, is ſaid to have largeneſs of heart, even as the ſand which is by the Sea ſhore, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 4.29. yet <hi>Solomons</hi> heart, compared with <hi>Adams</hi> innocency, or his own Soul now in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, was but a narrow heart. Between <hi>Pauls</hi> Soul in the body, and in glory, there is as great a diſproportion, as between a childe and <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 2. The Soul ſeparated dependeth not upon the Body, in reſpect of its operations. It dependeth not upon the body, for the knowledge either of immaterial, or material objects; both being preſent to the Soul, either by the eſſence of things themſelves, or by their intelligible ſpecies, or by the Divine eſſence ſupplying all ſpecies.</p>
               <p>Three things are required to the operation of the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; 1. An intelligent faculty. 2. Light to illuſtrate the
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:118295:170"/>underſtanding. 3 The preſence of the object with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; whatſoever is underſtood muſt be united with, and touch the underſtanding, which is done either by the eminent preſence of things in the Divine Eſſence,<note place="margin">Zanch. de o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peribus Dei part. <hi>3.</hi> l. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>2</hi>
                  </note> ſo the ſoul underſtands in glory; or by the formal preſence of the very things, ſo the Angels underſtand themſelves, and ſo, we (as ſome conceive) ſee the Light; or by the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, or image of the thing, commonly called a <hi>Species,</hi> ſo we underſtand intelligible objects in this Life.</p>
               <p>The ſoul whilſt it is in the body, dependeth not upon any corporcal organ, phantaſie, inward or outward ſenſe, as an inſtrument, whereby it underſtands; but as an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to repreſent the object to be underſtood; which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative faculty of the phantaſie, being performed, and that in a more eminent manner, either by the Divine Eſſence it ſelf, ſupplying thoſe <hi>Species;</hi> or by way of infuſion of them, at, or immediately upon the inſtant of its ſeparation, after the manner of the concreated <hi>Species</hi> of things in Angels; or by occaſional abſtraction of them from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: The ſoul ſeparated, remaineth free to its operations without the uſe of the body.</p>

As grace doth not deſtroy, but help; ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry doth not deſtroy, but perfect nature.

               </p>
               <p>The ſoul may be bleſſed, though the body be dead. We look too much upon the dead carkaſs, and too little upon the living ſoul. Chriſts body in the grave interrupts not the happineſſe of his ſoul in Paradiſe. As the body in the grave doth neither good nor evil, ſo it feeleth neither good nor evil. It is as if it were not, <hi>Joſeph</hi> is not, <hi>Ger.</hi> 42.36.</p>
               <p>The bodies of the Saints at death ceaſe for ever from ſin, and from all ſuffering that is felt; there is neither ſin, nor tear, in the grave; And from ſuffering it ſelf, at the Reſurrection. The body is neither ſenſible of the want of the ſoul, nor doth the ſoul feel any miſſe of the body.</p>
               <p>The body is neither ſenſible of good or evill concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf, nor concerning the ſoul; the ſoul, though it be not touched with any evill, yet it is affected with good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the body, whilſt it looks at it as ſown, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.43. As at reſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.2. As fallen a ſleep, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.6. As in Covenant with Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.32. all which phraſes are proper to the bodies of the Saints. The ſoul hath no grievance for the abſence of the body, yet it hath contenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:118295:171"/>in its Reſt, and a glad expectation of its future meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Such is the condition of the body in the grave, which yet we muſt ſo mind, as not forgetting the ſoul in glory.</p>
               <p>The body is at reſt, the ſoul is in bleſſedneſſe; that the one is at reſt, hindreth not the bleſſedneſſe of the other; the body is aſleep, but the ſoul putteth forth its perfect operations; The body is aſleep in the cuſtody of Jeſus, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.18. The ſoul beholds the face of Jeſus. <hi>Jacobs</hi> ſleeping body troubleth not his communion with Chriſt and his Angels, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. <hi>Pauls</hi> ſoul in the third heavens miſſeth not his body, though as may be ſuppoſed for the time ſoul-leſſe upon earth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.2. The condition of the ſoul, diſſolved in the Lord, is as it were a bleſſed rapture, laſting from our diſſolution to our reſurrection; though the grave be a land of darkneſs, as darkneſs it ſelf, and of the ſhadow of death, without any order, where the Light is as darkneſs, <hi>Job</hi> 10.22. yet is not that long-home of the body, ſo dark and diſorderly, as the everlaſting home of the ſoul is light and beautiful. The godly ſoul prepared ſhould be no more afraid of death in regard of the body, than of its fall into a kindly ſleep after weary labour, and as glad of diſſolution in reſpect of it ſelf, as of going to be with Chriſt, which is far better, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23.</p>

                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 4. The ſoul, from the inſtant of its diſſolution, is freed from all imperfections of ſin, ſorrow, and infirmity; <hi>God ſhall wipe away all tears from their eyes,</hi> Rev. 7.17. <hi>The ſpirits of juſt men are made perfect,</hi> Heb. 12.23.</p>

                  </note> ſo the ſpeech of the bleſſed Souls, is a power whereby (as they pleaſe) they make known one unto another what they know themſelves; our thoughts paſſe unto him, whom we communicate them unto, by two doors, <hi>viz.</hi> of volition or will, and expreſſion, whether by word, writing, or ſign; The Angels have but one door through which their thoughts paſs, namely, their wil. To think that the Angels and Spirits of the juſt made perfect doe not ſpeak men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, that is, in their heavenly and ſpiritual manner, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate their minds one unto another, as they ſee cauſe, is againſt reaſon, and inconſiſting with the ſtate of bleſſedneſs.

               <p>Great muſt needs be the content of their Communion, if we conſider either the neer relation of the perſons, being Members of the ſame Myſtical Body, or the manner of their meeting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ſweetned with more affecting ingredients, and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, than the meeting of <hi>Jacob, Joſeph,</hi> and <hi>Benjamin;</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether

               <p>The excellency of the glorified Body conſiſts eſpecially in two things:</p>
               <p n="1">1 In that we ſhal ſee Chriſt as he is Man, with theſe eyes. 2 In certain inherent Caeleſtial qualities. That we ſhal ſee Chriſt as he is Man with theſe eyes, <hi>Job</hi> manifeſtly teſtifieth; <hi>For I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he ſhall ſtand at the latter day upon the earth, and though after my skin worms deſtroy this body, yet in my fleſh ſhall I ſee God, whom I ſhall ſee for my ſelf; and mine eyes ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him, and not another,</hi> cap. 19.25, 26, 27.</p>
               <p>The ſight of Chriſt as Man is the next object unto the Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical Viſion it ſelf; as the created grace, which the Man-hood received was out of meaſure, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.34. (yet not ſimply, for being a creature it is bounded; but reſpectively, in regard of us, we being unable to meaſure it;) ſo the glory of the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is out of meaſure. The Humanity of Chriſt, in reſpect of its perſonal union, farre exceeds all the glory of Angels, and glorified Souls. The glory of the Man-hood, is as much as the Creature is capable of; the glory of the Body is derived both from the Divinity, and the glory of his Soul. The fulneſs of the God-head dwelling in him bodily, doth as it were radiate through his body; hence there muſt needs ariſe great joy unto the beholder, both from the eminency of, and our intereſt in this object. Chriſt in glory, and Chriſt in glory ours; as much of the Creator as is poſſibly viſible in the nature of man, wil be to be ſeen in Chriſt; as much contentation as the Creature can be made partaker of by the ſight of any one viſible object, wil be the portion of the beholders of Chriſt, as he is Man.</p>

               <p>Their vigor ſhal always laſt in the flower, height, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence of it, always in its moſt abſolute and perfect efficacy; that which we read of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Deut. 34.7. and which <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſpeaks of himſelf, Chap. 14.11. ſhal be verified concerning glorified Bodies, in a more excellent manner; <hi>Eliah</hi> is as lively, and fit for action now, as at the firſt moment of his entring into glory.</p>
               <p>Their activity, and aptneſs to action, exceeds what we can wel conceive; all the Saints in Heaven are ſuch as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired after, <hi>Gen.</hi> 47.6. perſons of activity.

<pb n="352" facs="tcp:118295:177"/>in fiery Chariot; but by the aſcenſion (according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Principle, and vertue of his glorified Body,) <hi>Luke</hi> 9. goeth up to the cloud eaſily and quickly, and Chriſt is quickly out of their ſight, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.9.

                  </note> which is the Eſſence of Bleſſedneſſe it ſelf; In this reſpect, the bleſſedneſs of the ſoul is the ſame both before and after the Reſurrection, there being the ſame principle, namely the glorified underſtanding, with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of the light of glory: The ſame ſubject, <hi>viz.</hi> The bleſſed ſoul; the ſame object, <hi>viz.</hi> God and Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Bleſſedneſſe is either eſſential, which conſiſts in the Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical Viſion it ſelf, or accidental, comprehending together with Eſſenital bleſſedneſſe, thoſe adjuncts of bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which are both antecedent and conſequent to the Reſurrection; in the latter ſenſe, the ſoul may be ſaid to be more bleſſed after the Reſurrection, than before.</p>
               <p>The Eſſential bleſſedneſſe of the ſoul is the ſame after the Reſurrection, with that which was before the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; but the joy of the ſoul, after the Re-union of the body, and thoſe Adjuncts of bleſſedneſſe, which are conſequent thereunto, will be greater than it was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly.</p>
               <p>We may diſtinguiſh between the bleſſedneſſe of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the bleſſedneſſe of the ſoul; the bleſſedneſs of the perſon (which conſiſts both of ſoul and body) ſhall be greater, though the Eſſential bleſſedneſs of the ſoul be the ſame.</p>
               <p>The frequent conſideration of the ſtate of the bleſſed is uſeful many wayes: Amongſt others, 1 To provoke us to labour to be ſuch, <hi>as may be made meet for this inheritance of the Saints that is in light.</hi> 2 To endeavour to attain, and retain the earneſt of the Spirit, whence we may alwayes be able to ſay, <hi>We are confident, and willing, rather to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from the body, and to be preſent with the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.8. 3 To fill the ſoul with ſtrong conſolation, againſt the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of life, and the fear of death. 4 To work an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable converſation, <hi>That whether abſent or preſent, we may ſo walk, as we may be accepted of him.</hi> 5 To diſpoſe us to a patient waiting for, and longing expectation of our change, which draweth on apace. Here it may not be
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:118295:178"/>unworthy the labour to reminde the ſtrong impreſſion, which the contemplation of immortality, hath left upon the hearts of Heathen.</p>
               <p>Good Authors report of ſome <hi>Indians</hi> ſo affectionately moved with the immortality of the ſoul ſeparated from the body, as that impatient of ſtaying for their diſſolution by a natural death, they with their own hands built thoſe piles of wood, wherein their bodies were to be burned, and then behold them ſet on fire, accounting them wiſeſt, that dyed ſooneſt. The hearers of one <hi>Hegeſias</hi> of <hi>Cyrene,</hi> reading of his Oration touching the ſtate of the ſoul after death, were ſo taken with it, that they looked at death as a thing to be deſired. <hi>Socrates</hi> at the point of ſuffering death, in teſtimony that there was but one God, comforts himſelf (over his draught of poyſon) with the meditation of this very ſubject. If I in this erre (faith <hi>Cato majer</hi>) that I beleeve the ſouls of men to be immortal, I erre wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, neither will I ever ſuffer this errour (in which I delight) to be wreſted from me as long as I live.</p>
               <p>If heathens having a dark view, and vain hope, of the immortality of the ſoul, were ſo remarkably, though paſſionately affected; what and how vigorous then ſhould the effects be, flowing from the ſtrong and ſolid conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of beleevers, who infallibly (though darkly) ſee here, what they ſhall hereafter both be, and ſee cleerly? Whom God hath wrought for the ſelf-ſame end, who alſo hath given us the earneſt of his Spirit; Thoſe are they who are, and ought to be, in Gods time willing to dye. We are confident I ſay, and willing, &amp;c. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.8. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to depart, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23. groaning earneſtly to be cloathed upon with that houſe which is from Heaven, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.2. Rejoycing in the finiſhing of their courſe, <hi>Act</hi> 20.24. Yea triumphing over death, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.55.</p>
               <p>How would it ſweeten the bitter waters of this Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to live and dye in the Mount, in the ſight of this <hi>Canaan,</hi> unto the comparative ſpeedineſs of Chriſts coming, at the Reſurrection, when we ſhall enjoy the bleſſedneſs of our
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:118295:178"/>perſons (which yet in it ſelf conſidered admits long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay) mentioned by the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> Chap. 10.37. as an effectual cordial againſt the ſorrows of this preſent life. Adde this conſideration of the bleſſedneſſe of our ſouls, which immediately follows upon our diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the body, and admits no delay, the ſoul is not ſooner out of this earthly, than it is in its heavenly houſe; it goeth as faſt into a better, as it goeth out of this miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable world, it is inſtantly with him in whom it findes all reſt, upon its ceaſing to be with man, of whom it ſhall there find no want. In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, before the eyes of the dead body are cloſed, the eye of the living ſoul ſhall behold the face of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Amen. Even ſo come Lord Jeſus.</hi>
